Choose Waste Connections FAQs A roll off dumpster is a type of large waste container that is typically used for temporary waste disposal needs. These dumpsters are commonly used for construction projects, home renovations, and other large-scale projects that generate a significant amount of waste. Roll off dumpsters are named for their ability to \"roll off\" of a truck or trailer and onto a customer's property. They are typically available in a range of sizes to accommodate different types of waste disposal needs, from large to small projects. Overall, roll off dumpsters are a convenient and cost-effective way to manage waste disposal needs for a variety of applications. The size of the roll-off dumpster you need for your project will depend on several factors, including the amount of waste you expect to generate and the type of material you will be disposing of. It's important to note that sizes are only general guidelines, and the amount of waste you generate can vary depending on the specific project. It's always better to order a slightly larger dumpster than you think you need rather than running out of space and needing to order an additional one. Additionally, local regulations may limit the size of dumpster you can use, so be sure to contact Waste Connections for any restrictions. The cost to rent a roll-off dumpster can vary depending on several factors, including the location, size of the dumpster, duration of the rental, weight limit, and type of debris.

Typically, larger cities and metropolitan areas will have higher rental costs than smaller towns or rural areas. Please contact Waste Connections for specific pricing information based on your location. The weight limits for a roll-off dumpster can differ based on various factors. These can include the size of the dumpster, the type of waste you're disposing of, and the policies set by the waste management company.

Whether you are looking to learn about designing meaningful learning experiences or landing an instructional design position, this site is for you. This site is dedicated to sharing about best instructional design tips, talking to amazing guests, and more. Sep 12 How to Recover When Your Project Becomes a Dumpster Fire Let‚Äôs say you are kicking off a new project. Everything on paper makes this project seem exciting. You have the right people in the room, a strong support system, a healthy budget, and an appropriate timeline. And then, one thing goes wrong. And another. And eventually, your beloved new project has become the bane of your existence. Every time you talk to your colleagues, they ask how ‚Äúthat‚Äù project is going. You pour another pot of coffee and scream into the void because this is now your life. If you are in this mess, what do you? Well, hey, I‚Äôve been here many times, and I‚Äôve made every mistake you can possibly think of. Let me share with you what I found was effective and hopefully, we can put out this dumpster fire project of yours. Pause and Assess the Situation When everything around you is burning, the logical response is to try and figure out how to put out the fire. You are rushing and scrambling trying to help, but it really doesn‚Äôt make a dent. While it‚Äôs the hardest thing to do, the first step is to pause and assess the situation. You need to be able to evaluate everything that is happening and identify what has gone wrong. Maybe it was a form of miscommunication, or an important stakeholder was left out of a meeting, or your timeline shifted unexpectedly. Whatever happened, you need to identify what is still salvageable, and where you should be spending your energy. The first step is to stop the bleeding and to buy yourself some time. Prioritize Critical Issues After taking some deep breaths, you should prioritize the critical issues. There most likely is a significant challenge or two that you should be dealing with immediately. While you want to fix everything at once, you simply can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the real-world. You need to determine the most pressing issues, prioritize them based on their impact, and focus on resolving the most critical ones first. One trick I found with dealing with so many issues at once is to write them all down on a whiteboard or on sticky notes. All of the information is in your brain, and you need to get this down on paper or somewhere for you to visually see them. Afterwards, you can rank them on what to deal with first. Once you have identified this, give it everything you got to fix this first critical issue. Communicate with Stakeholders and Team Members I cannot stress this point enough in that whatever you think you are doing for communicating, you can always do more. A personal issue of mine is that I have a hard time with the perception of over communicating. I perceive that I communicate too much and that my messages can be seen as an annoyance. I try to be respectful of people‚Äôs time because time is the only thing we can‚Äôt get back. And if I‚Äôm asking for someone‚Äôs time, there better be a good reason behind it. However, one project taught me that this isn‚Äôt always the case. From my perspective, if I‚Äôm not sending you an update, it means that there is no update to share. I‚Äôm not going to clog your inbox with a useless email. From the stakeholders‚Äô perspectives though, no email from me meant that I wasn‚Äôt doing my job. They reached out to my director asking why I wasn‚Äôt updating them and then she filtered this back to me. After hearing this, I decided to over communicate and to send weekly updates. This quickly changed the tide and I heard from several of them about how much they appreciated these updates. Some of these stakeholders even began offering their guidance as my updates would mention blockers. This made me realize that more is better, and I‚Äôd rather communicate too much than too little. The more transparent I was with them, the better things went. I would also say to make sure that you are proactively communicating with your team members, not just SMEs and other stakeholders. I am guilty of not asking for help soon enough. I‚Äôll try to put everything on my shoulders and then once things get truly bad, I‚Äôll ask for help. Obviously, I shouldn‚Äôt wait, and the more I discuss with them about what‚Äôs going on, the more they offer their time to help. They‚Äôve also mentioned ideas to help that I had never thought of before. Potentially, this can save you several headaches if you share the progress with your team. And as a reminder for me, and maybe for you, asking for help isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness. Create a New Plan Now is the time to create a new plan. Think about the new deadlines and adjust those timelines and expectations. I would also be thinking about the major milestones and once you‚Äôve accomplished these, it will continue to build the momentum for the project. For yourself, don‚Äôt forget about the small wins. I‚Äôm going to assume that this project has taken a massive amount of your mental energy. I know you still want to get everything done as quickly as possible, but embrace those moments and boost that motivation to get the job done. My director had to remind me of this a few times with my last insane project. We do check-ins on a bi-weekly basis and when I updated her with how much was completed since the last check-in, she was shocked. It took an outside perspective for me to realize that she was right. I didn‚Äôt see it that way and was still trying to rush to the next milestone, so reflect upon any win you get along the way. Stay Calm and Focused For this dumpster fire to turn around, you need to keep a clear head. After, months and months of frustration, it‚Äôs easy to carry over these feelings into your new plan. You need to treat this revised plan though as a fresh start. For instance, if something does happen to go wrong and it‚Äôs a minor inconvenience, months of baggage makes this feel like, ‚ÄúOh God, here we go again.‚Äù The reality though is that it‚Äôs a minor issue and can be resolved somewhat quickly. Anything that can take you a few minutes to solve is not a critical stage three meltdown, but it‚Äôs going to feel like it. Remind yourself that all things are figure-out-able. Reflect, Learn, and Grow After this calamity has passed, conduct a debrief with either your team, stakeholders, or even just yourself. Talk about what went well and what could‚Äôve been avoided and how to improve for the next time around. Chances are, you may end up working with the same stakeholders again, and if that‚Äôs the case, they will look to you for improvements. I learned to conduct retrospectives from an engineering professor, and it was such a great suggestion. It can feel awkward and uncomfortable to discuss where things went wrong with the project, but openly talking about this is so incredible valuable. Even if you don‚Äôt apply all of their suggestions and feedback, hearing them out will go a long way. I‚Äôd also consider building out risk management strategies for future projects. When you notice next time that things are taking a turn, you‚Äôll be more prepared to handle them. You and I both know that while we hope every project is going to go well, there will inevitably be another insane project that we are going to work on.

    "content": "Hello Learning Nerds! My purpose is to help you along your instructional design journey. Whether you are looking to learn about designing meaningful learning experiences or landing an instructional design position, this site is for you. This site is dedicated to sharing about best instructional design tips, talking to amazing guests, and more. Sep 12 How to Recover When Your Project Becomes a Dumpster Fire Let‚Äôs say you are kicking off a new project. Everything on paper makes this project seem exciting. You have the right people in the room, a strong support system, a healthy budget, and an appropriate timeline. And then, one thing goes wrong. And another. And eventually, your beloved new project has become the bane of your existence. Every time you talk to your colleagues, they ask how ‚Äúthat‚Äù project is going. You pour another pot of coffee and scream into the void because this is now your life. If you are in this mess, what do you? Well, hey, I‚Äôve been here many times, and I‚Äôve made every mistake you can possibly think of. Let me share with you what I found was effective and hopefully, we can put out this dumpster fire project of yours. Pause and Assess the Situation When everything around you is burning, the logical response is to try and figure out how to put out the fire. You are rushing and scrambling trying to help, but it really doesn‚Äôt make a dent. While it‚Äôs the hardest thing to do, the first step is to pause and assess the situation. You need to be able to evaluate everything that is happening and identify what has gone wrong. Maybe it was a form of miscommunication, or an important stakeholder was left out of a meeting, or your timeline shifted unexpectedly. Whatever happened, you need to identify what is still salvageable, and where you should be spending your energy. The first step is to stop the bleeding and to buy yourself some time. Prioritize Critical Issues After taking some deep breaths, you should prioritize the critical issues. There most likely is a significant challenge or two that you should be dealing with immediately. While you want to fix everything at once, you simply can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the real-world. You need to determine the most pressing issues, prioritize them based on their impact, and focus on resolving the most critical ones first. One trick I found with dealing with so many issues at once is to write them all down on a whiteboard or on sticky notes. All of the information is in your brain, and you need to get this down on paper or somewhere for you to visually see them. Afterwards, you can rank them on what to deal with first. Once you have identified this, give it everything you got to fix this first critical issue. Communicate with Stakeholders and Team Members I cannot stress this point enough in that whatever you think you are doing for communicating, you can always do more. A personal issue of mine is that I have a hard time with the perception of over communicating. I perceive that I communicate too much and that my messages can be seen as an annoyance. I try to be respectful of people‚Äôs time because time is the only thing we can‚Äôt get back. And if I‚Äôm asking for someone‚Äôs time, there better be a good reason behind it. However, one project taught me that this isn‚Äôt always the case. From my perspective, if I‚Äôm not sending you an update, it means that there is no update to share. I‚Äôm not going to clog your inbox with a useless email. From the stakeholders‚Äô perspectives though, no email from me meant that I wasn‚Äôt doing my job. They reached out to my director asking why I wasn‚Äôt updating them and then she filtered this back to me. After hearing this, I decided to over communicate and to send weekly updates. This quickly changed the tide and I heard from several of them about how much they appreciated these updates. Some of these stakeholders even began offering their guidance as my updates would mention blockers. This made me realize that more is better, and I‚Äôd rather communicate too much than too little. The more transparent I was with them, the better things went. I would also say to make sure that you are proactively communicating with your team members, not just SMEs and other stakeholders. I am guilty of not asking for help soon enough. I‚Äôll try to put everything on my shoulders and then once things get truly bad, I‚Äôll ask for help. Obviously, I shouldn‚Äôt wait, and the more I discuss with them about what‚Äôs going on, the more they offer their time to help. They‚Äôve also mentioned ideas to help that I had never thought of before. Potentially, this can save you several headaches if you share the progress with your team. And as a reminder for me, and maybe for you, asking for help isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness. Create a New Plan Now is the time to create a new plan. Think about the new deadlines and adjust those timelines and expectations. I would also be thinking about the major milestones and once you‚Äôve accomplished these, it will continue to build the momentum for the project. For yourself, don‚Äôt forget about the small wins. I‚Äôm going to assume that this project has taken a massive amount of your mental energy. I know you still want to get everything done as quickly as possible, but embrace those moments and boost that motivation to get the job done. My director had to remind me of this a few times with my last insane project. We do check-ins on a bi-weekly basis and when I updated her with how much was completed since the last check-in, she was shocked. It took an outside perspective for me to realize that she was right. I didn‚Äôt see it that way and was still trying to rush to the next milestone, so reflect upon any win you get along the way. Stay Calm and Focused For this dumpster fire to turn around, you need to keep a clear head. After, months and months of frustration, it‚Äôs easy to carry over these feelings into your new plan. You need to treat this revised plan though as a fresh start. For instance, if something does happen to go wrong and it‚Äôs a minor inconvenience, months of baggage makes this feel like, ‚ÄúOh God, here we go again.‚Äù The reality though is that it‚Äôs a minor issue and can be resolved somewhat quickly. Anything that can take you a few minutes to solve is not a critical stage three meltdown, but it‚Äôs going to feel like it. Remind yourself that all things are figure-out-able. Reflect, Learn, and Grow After this calamity has passed, conduct a debrief with either your team, stakeholders, or even just yourself. Talk about what went well and what could‚Äôve been avoided and how to improve for the next time around. Chances are, you may end up working with the same stakeholders again, and if that‚Äôs the case, they will look to you for improvements. I learned to conduct retrospectives from an engineering professor, and it was such a great suggestion. It can feel awkward and uncomfortable to discuss where things went wrong with the project, but openly talking about this is so incredible valuable. Even if you don‚Äôt apply all of their suggestions and feedback, hearing them out will go a long way. I‚Äôd also consider building out risk management strategies for future projects. When you notice next time that things are taking a turn, you‚Äôll be more prepared to handle them. You and I both know that while we hope every project is going to go well, there will inevitably be another insane project that we are going to work on.

As part of the on-going Dumpster Project, HT‚Äôs Dean of the University College and Associate Professor of Biological Sciences, Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka ‚ÄòProfessor Dumpster‚Äô has completed six months living in a modified trash dumpster. Phase II of the experiment will include a connection to the electrical grid, household appliances, and most amenities found in a modern home. Phase I, which launched on February 4, 2014, included living with no amenities, including sourcing water from Lady Bird Lake. Professor Dumpster and HT‚Äôs Green is the New BlackTM (GITNB) student organization renovated the dumpster to include a false floor ‚Äòbasement‚Äô that stores cooking equipment, bedding and clothing, an improved roof, solar lighting, bug repellant systems, and an online weather data station for the dumpster. The initial six month period provided a huge range of harsh weather conditions ‚Äì from record setting below freezing winter to triple-digit summer temperatures. ‚ÄúIt has been an interesting six months at home, especially with the harsh climate in Central Texas with temperatures in the dumpster approaching 130¬∞F,‚Äù said Professor Dumpster. I‚Äôve been looking forward to air conditioning and a bit more of a comfortable studio experience. As part of the sustainability experiment, GITNB has worked with local K-12 students and community partners on environmental science and awareness projects. HT students worked with Blackshear Elementary students, who built water filters, tested shade materials, and helped to plant the garden next to the dumpster. ‚ÄúThe Dumpster Project really stepped up awareness of sustainability issues here on campus amongst the students,‚Äù said Angelica Erazo, GITNB co-chair. ‚ÄúI can say that my experience, both working on the project and living in the dumpster for two nights, was a game changer in how I think about living a minimal life and lessening the impact on the planet.‚Äù Phase III of the experiment, dubbed ‚ÄòThe √úber Dumpster,‚Äô will launch in the spring of 2015. Phase III aims to combine the best aspects of the first two phases so that all the amenities of modern life will be included, operating with the smallest ecological footprint possible. Designs may include solar power generation, a composting toilet, a flat screen television, and a passive-solar heated shower. The Dumpster Project and HT‚Äôs Green is the New BlackTM have partnered with Texas Disposal Systems as the official home builder, Treehouse Green Building Supply as the chief home wares outfitter, and Whole Earth Provision company as the Phase I dumpster camping supplier. The project is also supported by The Ford Motor Company Fund‚Äôs Historically Black College and University (HBCU) Community Challenge, and Johnson Controls. ‚ÄúThis has been a learning experience unique to our students at Huston-Tillotson and our partner schools,‚Äù said Larry L. Earvin, Ph.D., HT president and chief executive officer. ‚ÄúThe experiment is a testament to HT‚Äôs commitment to stewarding the environment and becoming a leader in green innovation.‚Äù Huston-Tillotson University, Austin‚Äôs first institution of higher education, offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 20 areas of study, including Environmental Studies.

    "title": "Kasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism",
    "description": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \"iPhone for housing\". He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a ‚Äúrack‚Äù to become part of ‚Äúa vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink about an RV park‚Äù, explains Wilson, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.‚Äù\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. ‚ÄúThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, permitting, and the land. And the land‚Äôs the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing homeownership to someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn‚Äôt a real estate firm, but a product company. They‚Äôre not just selling their ‚ÄúiPhones for housing‚Äù, but they‚Äôre selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own ‚Äúvertical, high-end, urban trailer park‚Äù.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country,  these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n‚ÄúSo folks aren‚Äôt going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let‚Äôs say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you‚Äôre no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that‚Äôs the way that the world is moving.‚Äù\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn‚Äôt released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n\nhttps://kasita.com/\nPhoto credit (dumpster): Sarah Natsumi\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kasita-tiny-prefab-home-as-a-service-for-post-land-urbanism",

    "title": "Kasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism",
    "description": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \"iPhone for housing\". He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a ‚Äúrack‚Äù to become part of ‚Äúa vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink about an RV park‚Äù, explains Wilson, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.‚Äù\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. ‚ÄúThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, permitting, and the land. And the land‚Äôs the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing homeownership to someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn‚Äôt a real estate firm, but a product company. They‚Äôre not just selling their ‚ÄúiPhones for housing‚Äù, but they‚Äôre selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own ‚Äúvertical, high-end, urban trailer park‚Äù.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country,  these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n‚ÄúSo folks aren‚Äôt going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let‚Äôs say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you‚Äôre no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that‚Äôs the way that the world is moving.‚Äù\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn‚Äôt released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n\nhttps://kasita.com/\nPhoto credit (dumpster): Sarah Natsumi\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kasita-tiny-prefab-home-as-a-service-for-post-land-urbanism",

When I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: ‚ÄúKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed. Kasita Founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \"Professor Dumpster\". Courtesy of Kasita Over the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It‚Äôs not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives‚Äîfrom banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation‚Äînow runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn‚Äôt moved an inch in 128 years? Seeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or ‚Äúsmall home‚Äù) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence. Courtesy of Kasita Broadly speaking, Wilson‚Äôs Kasita falls into the architectural category of prefabricated micro housing, sharing common themes with the tiny house movement like surgically efficient use of interior space and small-scale affordability. Conceptually, Kasita is what you‚Äôd end up with if you crossbred a chic, modern Airstream with a container house and nested it inside of an automated parking garage.

Wilson‚Äôs Model One prototype, which was recently unveiled at South By Southwest, is a sleek, simplistic glass-and-steel box that can get up and go when life says it‚Äôs time for a change. Each Kasita slides into an engineered steel exo-skeleton that can be built in under a week on any open lot in any city up to ten stories high (for now). If you need‚Äîor want‚Äîto move, your Kasita comes with you. Just power up you app, schedule your move from Austin to Chicago, and grab your duffle bag. A crane and a flatbed truck scheduled by Wilson‚Äôs team will take care of the rest. Packing? Forget about it. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs vision to provide ‚Äúattainable‚Äù, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster. ‚ÄúI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,‚Äù Wilson recalls. ‚ÄúI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster‚Äù. 'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita In early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson‚Äôs goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúun-American‚Äù; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson‚Äôs decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think. ‚ÄúMost nights I‚Äôd just stare at the dumpster ceiling,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúAnd one night I had the first of two ‚Äòa-ha‚Äô moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn‚Äôt own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding ‚Äúmicro housing‚Äù. When you say the word ‚Äúpre-manufactured‚Äù most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a ‚ÄúMurphy bed‚Äù the answer will simply be ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîbecause no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. ‚ÄúI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita When Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson‚Äôs first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn‚Äôt reinvent real estate through architecture alone. \"I told him, ‚ÄòI want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that‚Äôs like a Tesla to drive‚Äô\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing‚Äîand he didn't know much‚Äîand make something truly iconic.\" Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita The result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you‚Äôre on your way home ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to just make Kasita ‚Äòsmart‚Äô‚Äù, Wilson explains, ‚ÄúWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of ‚Äúreasonable housing‚Äù is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can‚Äôt attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta. Courtesy of Kasita ‚ÄúIt you really think about it,‚Äù Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There‚Äôs a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it‚Äôs tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn‚Äôt even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.‚Äù So what‚Äôs it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just put it this way,‚Äù Wilson tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.‚Äù But remember we‚Äôre talking about your house here."

Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs vision to provide ‚Äúattainable‚Äù, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster. ‚ÄúI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,‚Äù Wilson recalls. ‚ÄúI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster‚Äù. 'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita In early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson‚Äôs goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúun-American‚Äù; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson‚Äôs decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think. ‚ÄúMost nights I‚Äôd just stare at the dumpster ceiling,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúAnd one night I had the first of two ‚Äòa-ha‚Äô moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn‚Äôt own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding ‚Äúmicro housing‚Äù. When you say the word ‚Äúpre-manufactured‚Äù most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a ‚ÄúMurphy bed‚Äù the answer will simply be ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîbecause no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. ‚ÄúI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita When Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson‚Äôs first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn‚Äôt reinvent real estate through architecture alone. \"I told him, ‚ÄòI want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that‚Äôs like a Tesla to drive‚Äô\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing‚Äîand he didn't know much‚Äîand make something truly iconic.\" Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita The result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you‚Äôre on your way home ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to just make Kasita ‚Äòsmart‚Äô‚Äù, Wilson explains, ‚ÄúWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of ‚Äúreasonable housing‚Äù is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can‚Äôt attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta. Courtesy of Kasita ‚ÄúIt you really think about it,‚Äù Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There‚Äôs a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it‚Äôs tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn‚Äôt even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.‚Äù So what‚Äôs it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just put it this way,‚Äù Wilson tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.‚Äù But remember we‚Äôre talking about your house here."

A rendering of Kasita‚Äôs planned flagship hotel project in the Austin area, which the company expects to launch in 2020. Though the firm can‚Äôt confirm its location for the moment, the site seen in the image appears to be the former site of the second planned Kimber Modern hotel on Elizabeth Street in South Austin. Image: Kasita The new startup, which shares no ownership with the previous company, is now described plainly on its site as a hospitality operation, and makes no bones about this radically different new identity. Though its predecessors managed to build an unspecified number of housing units, some of which can be found as accessory dwellings around Austin, the new Kasita will no longer sell tiny homes to consumers. The previous Kasita tiny house company was founded in 2015 with an ambitious vision. They created one of the most innovative and highly regarded tiny homes on the market. Unfortunately, there was not enough consumer demand to support their plan to manufacture and sell tiny homes directly to consumers, and the previous Kasita tiny house company ceased operations. ‚Äî Kasita.com An interior view of a Kasita suite.

Given its modular design, the key count for a Kasita hotel project should scale to the needs and constraints of a given site, its units linked by shared common spaces. Interior images of a Kasita unit in its original residential configuration (left) and its hotel suite design (right). Images: Kasita Kasita‚Äôs business model, assuming it‚Äôs successfully implemented, opens up some interesting land-use opportunities. Not unlike a food truck park occupying a vacant property until the financial stars align for the site‚Äôs development somewhere down the road, a Kasita hotel would temporarily activate and monetize empty lots that might otherwise sit vacant for years as part of an owner‚Äôs land-banking scheme. For landowners, Kasita offers the opportunity to activate luxury hospitality on their properties in a fraction of the time and at a cost savings of up to 50% compared to conventional projects. Kasitas are permanent structures but are precision built in a factory and can be moved opportunistically at a low cost. This unlocks land-banking opportunities and the ability to ‚Äútuck in‚Äù Kasitas at existing destinations like wineries with minimal disruption. ‚Äî Kasita.com In their previous lives as homes, Kasita units could be easily transported and placed via flatbed truck and crane, and the new hotel use likely hasn‚Äôt changed this feature ‚Äî meaning these hotels could pop up quickly and leave just as fast, which the company says could cut development costs in half compared with traditional construction. A rendering of a communal outdoor amenity space at a Kasita hotel. Image: Kasita Though the demise of the original Kasita dwelling concept is disappointing, it‚Äôs not a complete surprise ‚Äî the individual unit cost remained higher than what the market for this asset class would support. As an income-generating hotel platform, however, the benefits of its striking design and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technology seem a bit more obvious. With the new Kasita expecting to launch its flagship Austin location in 2020, we‚Äôll soon find out whether the startup‚Äôs second life sticks around.

    "content": "TOWERS Austin city life since 2007 Austin‚Äôs Tiny Home Startup Kasita Rides Again, With Tiny Hotels in Mind James Rambin July 30, 2019 Comment The exterior of a Kasita unit. Image: Kasita Kasita, an Austin startup founded in 2015 amid significant local and national buzz for its prefabricated ‚Äútiny smart home‚Äù concept, is officially no more. Rising in its place is Kasita, a new firm fashioned in the rough image of its predecessor, but with a notably different application imagined for the modular dwelling technology constituting the previous company‚Äôs legacy ‚Äî boutique hotel development, built one suite at a time. A rendering of Kasita‚Äôs planned flagship hotel project in the Austin area, which the company expects to launch in 2020. Though the firm can‚Äôt confirm its location for the moment, the site seen in the image appears to be the former site of the second planned Kimber Modern hotel on Elizabeth Street in South Austin. Image: Kasita The new startup, which shares no ownership with the previous company, is now described plainly on its site as a hospitality operation, and makes no bones about this radically different new identity. Though its predecessors managed to build an unspecified number of housing units, some of which can be found as accessory dwellings around Austin, the new Kasita will no longer sell tiny homes to consumers. The previous Kasita tiny house company was founded in 2015 with an ambitious vision. They created one of the most innovative and highly regarded tiny homes on the market. Unfortunately, there was not enough consumer demand to support their plan to manufacture and sell tiny homes directly to consumers, and the previous Kasita tiny house company ceased operations. ‚Äî Kasita.com An interior view of a Kasita suite. Image: Kasita It appears the design of the Kasita unit, previously described as ideal for prefabricated multifamily communities, works just as well in the context of a hotel. The new Kasita‚Äôs co-founders are self-described ‚Äúserial entrepreneurs‚Äù Kenny Tomlin and Richard Lent, who both have previous experience in this world ‚Äî Tomlin, also the CEO of commercial real estate firm Elevate Growth Partners, co-owns the Kimber Modern boutique hotel with Lent near South Congress Avenue‚Äôs entertainment district. Even without considering the minimalist design influences shared between the two, you might think of the seven-room Kimber as a testbed for the type of experience Kasita‚Äôs hotels appear designed to deliver ‚Äî with check-ins, keyless entry, and communication with staff all conducted via email and text message, a low-impact approach shared by boutique newcomers like Arrive East Austin.

I wasn‚Äôt a great student in high school and started out at a community college. I love that the Extension School provides access to higher education for folks who may not have been given clear pathways into that world or may not initially see themselves in it. VIDEO: Dr. Wilson shares why he enjoys teaching at Harvard Extension. The range of life experiences and perspectives in our classes‚Äîstudents from around the world and at different ages and stages of life‚Äîactivates a quality of conversation that you really can‚Äôt get anywhere else. Why Shakespeare? Shakespeare provides an amazing opportunity to bridge past and present when thinking about big ethical questions‚Äîhis plays are deeply informed by ancient art, culture, and thought but they‚Äôre also very alive today around the world in new performances and adaptations. Check out Dr. Wilson‚Äôs guest appearance on the Folger Library‚Äôs Shakespeare Lightning Round on Instagram. I like tracing these centuries-long intellectual debates and conversations to see how different people with different circumstances, values, and commitments can interpret the same story in very different ways. Academic Writing Advice for Students Writing is easy when you‚Äôve got something to say. The hard part is building an idea that‚Äôs worth writing a paper about. That‚Äôs where you should spend your time and energy. Embrace your perspective‚Äîthe worldview you bring to your writing that‚Äôs informed by your experiences and values. You have hard-won expertise and authority to speak from that perspective, which allows you to shift from someone trying to convince a reader to believe something to someone with knowledge that their reader may not have and desperately needs. Connecting with Students In our Fundamentals of Grammar course, we do a series of assignments called ‚ÄúWriting You Can Use.‚Äù The stories that grow from that assignment are amazing‚Äîfrom emails to long-lost friends that rekindled relationships to successful job applications to published opinion articles in local newspapers to the letter a student sent (from her new typewriter) to Tom Hanks (who is apparently a typewriter enthusiast) that he responded to (from his typewriter). More About Jeffrey Wilson Jeffrey R. Wilson is a Shakespeare scholar at Harvard University. He is the author of three books: Richard III‚Äôs Bodies from Medieval England to Modernity: Shakespeare and Disability History (2022), Shakespeare and Game of Thrones (2021), and Shakespeare and Trump (2020).

The Dumpster Project Wilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6] \"No Baggage\" experiment Together with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43] 99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment Subsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45] Academic Work Wilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston‚ÄìTillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48] References"

About This Episode As Professor Dumpster, Jeff has lived in a 33 sq. ft. modified trash dumpster as part of an environmental education and minimalist housing experiment. His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post. Jeff talked to us about his ‚ÄúDumpster Project‚Äù as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff‚Äôs latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience. In our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and‚Ä¶ fundraising at the urinals. Episode transcript Greg Miaskiewicz: So, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism? Jeff Wilson: I like that term. Is there an acronym? Greg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC. Jeff Wilson: HIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan. Greg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC. Jeff Wilson: So it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth. So I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water. So did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software. Of course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good enough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.

The Dumpster Project Wilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6] \"No Baggage\" experiment Together with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43] 99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment Subsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45] Academic Work Wilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston‚ÄìTillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48] References"

    "description": "ANU Research School of Biology researcher Dr Weliton Men√°rio Costa entered this year's Dance Your PhD competition run by Science Magazine and took out the top prize! Take a behind the scenes look at how he conveyed his research on eastern grey kangaroos through dance.\n\nFor more visit https://science.anu.edu.au/\n\n#DanceYourPhD #Science #stem \n\nScience and Artistic Rationale by Dr Weliton Men√°rio Costa :\n\nIn our 2024 AAAS/Science Magazine Dance Your Ph.D. Contest submission, we explore kangaroo behavior through dance and promote diversity. The performance, titled \"Kangaroo Time\", is based on my Ph.D. field research at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Australia, conducted at the Australian National University in collaboration with the University of Sherbrooke, Canada. My thesis, \"Personality, Social Environment, and Maternal-Level Effects: Insights from a Wild Kangaroo Population\", is accessible here: https://openresearch-repository.anu.e....  I am honored to have worked under the expert supervision of Prof Loeske Kruuk and Prof Marco Festa-Bianchet.\n\nWe delve into animal personality, defined as consistent behavior that distinguishes individuals, and social plasticity, the extent to which behavior changes in response to the social environment. We explain how both personality traits and social environment influence kangaroo behavior, including responses to stimuli like a remote-controlled car, and we demonstrate the role of personality on social dynamics.\n\nThe diversity of the dancers, ranging from classical to urban styles, reflects the variations in kangaroo personality, e.g. bolder to shier. These dancers, unchoreographed, improvise their movements, responding to cues and interacting with each other. The dance thus serves as a visual narrative, capturing how kangaroos react based not only on their instincts but also on their social context. This approach demonstrates that kangaroo decisions are a complex interplay of intrinsic tendencies (personality) and social awareness leading to adjustment (plasticity). I hope this performance makes the scientific concepts both accessible and engaging for the audience.\n\nI completed my Ph.D. at the Australian National University, Canberra, in 2021, and worked as a Research Officer. Now, I'm pursuing music, having released my debut EP \"Yours Academically, Dr. WELI\" and the single \"Kangaroo Time (Club Edit),\" featured in the video. This project represents a fusion of my scientific work and my foray into performance and creative arts, combining animal behavior with artistic expression.\n\nStaring \nFaux NeÃÅe Phish\nHolly Hazlewood\nMarina de Andrade\nMegan Aponte-Payne\nTrish Dias\nShelly Giorgi\nCrystal Prior\nLaura Pelaez\nWendy Xin Xiao\nOlivia Sutton\nJazz Zollinger\nCynthia \nMogendhri M√ºller\nThomas M√ºller\nLucas Nelson\nChichi Curtarelli\nRachael Remington\nTrevor Unmack\nAndrew Unmack\nGeorgina Negem\nChily\nJeff\nDavid Pandora\nValqu√≠ria Men√°rio Costa",

Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth. So I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water. So did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software. Of course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good enough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.

    "description": "Affected communities hold key insights that are critical to understanding and addressing complex environmental, social, and health challenges. Effectively engaging these communities requires going beyond making the outputs of science accessible. Instead, it calls for forging meaningful partnerships that span the research process, from idea conception to data interpretation, in order to create a more equitable scientific enterprise and policy ecosystem. The Year of Open Science reaffirmed the vital role of government actors in supporting open and inclusive science. To help build on that momentum, the Federation of American Scientists partnered with the Center for Open Science and the Wilson Center to run an Open Science Policy accelerator aimed at advancing new, ambitious policy ideas. In this session, participants from the accelerator will discuss innovative approaches that the U.S. government could take to foster community engagement in science. Their proposals aim to both enhance the inclusivity of scientific research and to ensure that federal policies are grounded in diverse perspectives and realworld contexts.",

    "content": "Contents Jeff Wilson (professor) Jeff Wilson is an American academic[1] and serial startup entrepreneur.[2] The pseudonym Professor Dumpster is based upon his role as part of 'The Dumpster Project',[3] an educational and minimalist living experiment that transformed a trash dumpster into a fully sustainable home. Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4] Jupe In 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5] Kasita Wilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas. The Dumpster Project Wilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6] \"No Baggage\" experiment Together with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43] 99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment Subsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45] Academic Work Wilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston‚ÄìTillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48] References"

    "description": "ANU Research School of Biology researcher Dr Weliton Men√°rio Costa entered this year's Dance Your PhD competition run by Science Magazine and took out the top prize! Take a behind the scenes look at how he conveyed his research on eastern grey kangaroos through dance.\n\nFor more visit https://science.anu.edu.au/\n\n#DanceYourPhD #Science #stem \n\nScience and Artistic Rationale by Dr Weliton Men√°rio Costa :\n\nIn our 2024 AAAS/Science Magazine Dance Your Ph.D. Contest submission, we explore kangaroo behavior through dance and promote diversity. The performance, titled \"Kangaroo Time\", is based on my Ph.D. field research at Wilsons Promontory National Park, Australia, conducted at the Australian National University in collaboration with the University of Sherbrooke, Canada. My thesis, \"Personality, Social Environment, and Maternal-Level Effects: Insights from a Wild Kangaroo Population\", is accessible here: https://openresearch-repository.anu.e....  I am honored to have worked under the expert supervision of Prof Loeske Kruuk and Prof Marco Festa-Bianchet.\n\nWe delve into animal personality, defined as consistent behavior that distinguishes individuals, and social plasticity, the extent to which behavior changes in response to the social environment. We explain how both personality traits and social environment influence kangaroo behavior, including responses to stimuli like a remote-controlled car, and we demonstrate the role of personality on social dynamics.\n\nThe diversity of the dancers, ranging from classical to urban styles, reflects the variations in kangaroo personality, e.g. bolder to shier. These dancers, unchoreographed, improvise their movements, responding to cues and interacting with each other. The dance thus serves as a visual narrative, capturing how kangaroos react based not only on their instincts but also on their social context. This approach demonstrates that kangaroo decisions are a complex interplay of intrinsic tendencies (personality) and social awareness leading to adjustment (plasticity). I hope this performance makes the scientific concepts both accessible and engaging for the audience.\n\nI completed my Ph.D. at the Australian National University, Canberra, in 2021, and worked as a Research Officer. Now, I'm pursuing music, having released my debut EP \"Yours Academically, Dr. WELI\" and the single \"Kangaroo Time (Club Edit),\" featured in the video. This project represents a fusion of my scientific work and my foray into performance and creative arts, combining animal behavior with artistic expression.\n\nStaring \nFaux NeÃÅe Phish\nHolly Hazlewood\nMarina de Andrade\nMegan Aponte-Payne\nTrish Dias\nShelly Giorgi\nCrystal Prior\nLaura Pelaez\nWendy Xin Xiao\nOlivia Sutton\nJazz Zollinger\nCynthia \nMogendhri M√ºller\nThomas M√ºller\nLucas Nelson\nChichi Curtarelli\nRachael Remington\nTrevor Unmack\nAndrew Unmack\nGeorgina Negem\nChily\nJeff\nDavid Pandora\nValqu√≠ria Men√°rio Costa",

    "content": "King County Local News from the King County Department of Local Services Program Manager brings international experience in environmental infrastructure, marine project management to help develop shared septic system in Fall City Jeff Wilson has helped address complicated infrastructure problems across the globe ‚Äì Italy, Kazakhstan, even the Deepwater Horizon MC252 Oil Spill. But the puzzle he‚Äôll work to solve for King County Local Services sits here in his backyard. The Program Manager and Fall City resident‚Äôs main goal is to help deliver a shared septic system to the unincorporated area near Snoqualmie, which business owners have requested for decades and say could unlock the potential of the area‚Äôs aging commercial buildings. Jeff says he‚Äôs up for the challenge. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of momentum for this work, especially from the community,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI love this community. And in my experience, when you‚Äôre passionate about the community and want to work together, good things can happen.‚Äù Jeff brings with him a wealth of experience in environment science and engineering. Before coming to King County, he worked more than a decade with research and consulting firm Gravity Marine in Seattle, which served clients worldwide. His most recent role was Technical Services Director, managing a team of scientists, engineers and technicians and lending expertise on regulatory requirements and permitting policy. Prior to that, he was a Senior Project Engineer and Staff Scientist who worked on several environmental permitting and monitored projects in marine and environmentally sensitive areas. The list of projects he has overseen is expansive, including serving as the lead scientist on multiple research vessels that investigated the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He also served as Technical Manager for the installation of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline near Italy and worked in a similar capacity for development of a sea port in the Caspian Sea. Of course, Jeff has lead and collaborated on several marine infrastructure projects in the Puget Sound and on the Columbia River.

Yet as political tensions rose, US-China climate talks stalled. Over the past two years both countries have been taking steps to independently accelerate their climate action at home and overseas.  \n\nAt this CEF meeting, panelists unpacked some of China‚Äôs progress or slippage in climate action since 2021, with some comparison to trends in the United States. Lili Pike (Freelance Writer) discussed the impact of deteriorating US-China relations on climate action in both countries. Drawing on her reporting on the electric vehicle and battery industries, she spoke about the meteoric rise of China's EV industry and the trade-offs the US is making between competing with China in the EV space and cutting emissions. Kyle Obermann (Environmental Photographer) highlighted insights from his US-China Journey to Net Zero documentary. He also discussed China‚Äôs expanding nature-based climate solutions through national park planning and wild-land protection.",

Effectively engaging these communities requires going beyond making the outputs of science accessible. Instead, it calls for forging meaningful partnerships that span the research process, from idea conception to data interpretation, in order to create a more equitable scientific enterprise and policy ecosystem. The Year of Open Science reaffirmed the vital role of government actors in supporting open and inclusive science. To help build on that momentum, the Federation of American Scientists partnered with the Center for Open Science and the Wilson Center to run an Open Science Policy accelerator aimed at advancing new, ambitious policy ideas. In this session, participants from the accelerator will discuss innovative approaches that the U.S. government could take to foster community engagement in science. Their proposals aim to both enhance the inclusivity of scientific research and to ensure that federal policies are grounded in diverse perspectives and realworld contexts.",

You‚Äôll learn how to educate, communicate, and advocate for environmental solutions with diverse audiences from youth to adults. Honors Program in Natural Sciences Environmental studies majors can opt to participate in the honors program, which grants honors recognition on your degree. To graduate with honors, you must earn a 3.5 GPA, complete an independent research project or internship, and present your work to the faculty. What is \"environmental studies\"? This interdisciplinary major focuses on how our social and political systems influence how we work. This program might be for you if you‚Äôre interested in the interaction of subjects like: Environmental policy Environmental justice Political ecology Environmental History Education Park interpretation Sociology Community activism Urban gardening Explore Classes in This Program Everybody's Environment! People, Place, and Planet 21st-century environmental work is personal and political; scientific and poetic; local, regional, and global! And maybe most of all: terrifying and hopeful. With our southern Appalachian ecoregion for a classroom, you‚Äôll deepen your understanding of today‚Äôs intersectional environmental problems and solutions in the classroom and the community. Environmental Sociology This course focuses on the interrelationship between natural and social environments. Although the course covers a broad range of issues, emphasis will be given to the development of environmental sociology; various perspectives in environmental sociology; environment and culture; environmental justice; the interrelationship of ideology, materialism, and the environment; global environmental issues; and environmental activism. Environmental Leadership in Community Guided by case studies in successful environmental protection, you‚Äôll apply your interdisciplinary skills and knowledge to help plan and carry out an environmental protection project in the region. I am more guide than teacher; I love guiding intelligent, passionate students as they help change the world not just after they graduate, but as part of their educational experience. As I field biologist, I always say our best laboratories are right out the back door of the science building. Within a 5 minute walk we have 3 ponds, a trout stream and 600 acres of Forest. Teaching and learning at Warren Wilson is not for the faint of heart! And some days I wake up tired. But the strong-hearted, active-minded students and educators, busy together in this beautiful valley and beyond, send me home energized every day. The best part of the job is watching students graduate with a strong portfolio of experiences and find meaningful work connecting people to places. I believe my responsibility is not only as an instructor but as a mentor and a resource for the future. My classes are not just an experience with a grade; they are an opportunity to build social capital. Everywhere you look there's a story to be told here at Wilson. It's my job to help guide my students to see these stories and learn how to best share them with the world. Warren Wilson has some of the most accessible experiential learning opportunities of any college campus in the country. It is one of the primary reasons why I wanted to be here as a faculty member, particularly when the forest is a stone‚Äôs throw away from the classroom! At Warren Wilson, I have most enjoyed learning from my students as much as I am teaching them. Their wealth of experiences has not only been valuable in my lessons, but I have learned so much from them as well! I believe curiosity is the seed of hope. I approach education as a way to cultivate my students' curiosities about the world and how they can engage with it. Warren Wilson students crave a challenge. I am continually amazed at the enthusiasm with which our students throw themselves into an endeavor, whether it be a physically exhausting service trip or an intellectually stimulating research question. Wilson students tend to say ‚Äúbring it.‚Äù Warren Wilson students are poised to learn and to expand their horizons. Hands-on, All-in Like this program? You might like these too.

    "content": "Professor Dumpster Air Date: Week of October 3, 2014 Professor Wilson, otherwise known as Dr. Dumpster, resides in a modern dumpster behind the women‚Äôs dorm at Huston-Tillotson University. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) At Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he‚Äôs lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster. Professor Wilson, otherwise known as Dr. Dumpster, resides in a modern dumpster behind the women‚Äôs dorm at Huston-Tillotson University. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) At Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he‚Äôs lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster. Transcript CURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it‚Äôs hardly the kind of home you‚Äôd expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster ‚Äì a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he‚Äôs Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, ‚ÄúProfessor Dumpster?‚Äù WILSON: I‚Äôll take Professor Dumpster and you‚Äôre at my disposal. CURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have? WILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet. Professor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore) CURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics? WILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis. CURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come? WILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that‚Äôs the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well. Dr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you? WILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster. CURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home? Professor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore) WILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home. CURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing? WILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV. Egress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going? WILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic. [LAUGHS] Professor Wilson‚Äôs students peek in through the dumpster‚Äôs ‚Äúwindow‚Äù. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster? WILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests‚Äîand these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we‚Äôve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of ‚Äúcouch-surfing‚Äù itself, dumpster-surfing. CURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you. WILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick. CURWOOD: Ooooh. WILSON: [LAUGHS] CURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish? WILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it‚Äîthat you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be‚Äîas some have suggested Obama's new housing plan‚Äîas long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal. CURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover. WILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you‚Äôre around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by. CURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.

(Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster? WILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests‚Äîand these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we‚Äôve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of ‚Äúcouch-surfing‚Äù itself, dumpster-surfing. CURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you. WILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick. CURWOOD: Ooooh. WILSON: [LAUGHS] CURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish? WILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it‚Äîthat you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be‚Äîas some have suggested Obama's new housing plan‚Äîas long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal. CURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover. WILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you‚Äôre around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by. CURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.

By Kimya Kavehkar This month, Jeff Wilson, an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University, is moving into a 33-square-foot trash receptacle on the college‚Äôs East Austin campus with just a sleeping bag and a mosquito net. Eventually, he hopes to turn his new home into a full-on ‚Äúspace capsule in a trash can‚Äù with WiFi, air conditioning, an Xbox and other modern luxuries. The yearlong class experiment, called The Dumpster Project, is out to prove that people can live in a lot less space but still have a rich‚Äîif not richer‚Äîlife. Who did you consult with for the project? I recruited a world-class team that includes one of the top green designers in the world, one of the top water energy experts and people in the STEM education community. They‚Äôre acting as an advisory board. But the students do the real design and thought-process work on this. Why a dumpster and not some other small space? You get a very shocking reaction when you tell people at a cocktail party that you‚Äôre living in a dumpster. They don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great.

(Photo: Jeff Wilson) At Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he‚Äôs lived for a year.

Professor Wilson, otherwise known as Dr. Dumpster, resides in a modern dumpster behind the women‚Äôs dorm at Huston-Tillotson University. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) At Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he‚Äôs lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster. Transcript CURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it‚Äôs hardly the kind of home you‚Äôd expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster ‚Äì a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he‚Äôs Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, ‚ÄúProfessor Dumpster?‚Äù WILSON: I‚Äôll take Professor Dumpster and you‚Äôre at my disposal. CURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have? WILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet. Professor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore) CURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics? WILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis. CURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come? WILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that‚Äôs the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well. Dr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you? WILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster. CURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home? Professor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore) WILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home. CURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing? WILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV. Egress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going? WILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic. [LAUGHS] Professor Wilson‚Äôs students peek in through the dumpster‚Äôs ‚Äúwindow‚Äù.

    "title": "Kasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism",
    "description": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \"iPhone for housing\". He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a ‚Äúrack‚Äù to become part of ‚Äúa vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink about an RV park‚Äù, explains Wilson, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.‚Äù\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. ‚ÄúThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, permitting, and the land. And the land‚Äôs the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing homeownership to someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn‚Äôt a real estate firm, but a product company. They‚Äôre not just selling their ‚ÄúiPhones for housing‚Äù, but they‚Äôre selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own ‚Äúvertical, high-end, urban trailer park‚Äù.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country,  these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n‚ÄúSo folks aren‚Äôt going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let‚Äôs say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you‚Äôre no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that‚Äôs the way that the world is moving.‚Äù\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn‚Äôt released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n\nhttps://kasita.com/\nPhoto credit (dumpster): Sarah Natsumi\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kasita-tiny-prefab-home-as-a-service-for-post-land-urbanism",

    "description": "He lived in a dumpster, then designed a slick plug-and-play prefab that got stuck in permitting purgatory, but now Jeff Wilson, AKA \"Professor Dumpster,\" has released an ultra-nimble modular shelter that he believes could circumvent permits and deploys in just an hour (solar, water and all). And, he‚Äôs offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\n\nVideo on Kasita tiny prefab (Jeff's previous endeavor): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jF9ftC6U0Y\n\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. ‚ÄúArriving with all the essentials ‚Äòin the box‚Äô‚Äîincluding a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels, and backup batteries, and even the linens‚ÄîJupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,‚Äù explains Wilson. \n\nDespite its canvas cladding, Wilson calls it ‚Äúmore a device than a tent: Jupe‚Äôs units are built on an innovative ‚Äúchassis‚Äù foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.‚Äù This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so ‚Äúpermits are rarely necessary‚Äù. \n\nWilson says it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living, currently, they are ideal for not only short-term rentals but as popup disaster relief shelter. \n\nOn the ‚ÄúSlow Coast‚Äù of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\n\nTo rent your land & partner with Jupe: https://jupe.com/partner\nWallace J.

    "title": "Kasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism",
    "description": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \"iPhone for housing\". He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a ‚Äúrack‚Äù to become part of ‚Äúa vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink about an RV park‚Äù, explains Wilson, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.‚Äù\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. ‚ÄúThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, permitting, and the land. And the land‚Äôs the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing homeownership to someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn‚Äôt a real estate firm, but a product company. They‚Äôre not just selling their ‚ÄúiPhones for housing‚Äù, but they‚Äôre selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own ‚Äúvertical, high-end, urban trailer park‚Äù.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country,  these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n‚ÄúSo folks aren‚Äôt going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let‚Äôs say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you‚Äôre no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that‚Äôs the way that the world is moving.‚Äù\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn‚Äôt released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n\nhttps://kasita.com/\nPhoto credit (dumpster): Sarah Natsumi\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kasita-tiny-prefab-home-as-a-service-for-post-land-urbanism",

    "content": "More From Forbes Meet Kasita: The Micro-Housing Start-Up That's About To Revolutionize Real Estate You can tell immediately that Jeff Wilson, the 42-year old founder of Kasita, an Austin-based micro-housing start-up, has been courting venture capital. He has his sales pitch nailed‚Äîwhich is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster. When I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: ‚ÄúKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed. Kasita Founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \"Professor Dumpster\". Courtesy of Kasita Over the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It‚Äôs not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives‚Äîfrom banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation‚Äînow runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn‚Äôt moved an inch in 128 years? Seeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or ‚Äúsmall home‚Äù) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence. Courtesy of Kasita Broadly speaking, Wilson‚Äôs Kasita falls into the architectural category of prefabricated micro housing, sharing common themes with the tiny house movement like surgically efficient use of interior space and small-scale affordability. Conceptually, Kasita is what you‚Äôd end up with if you crossbred a chic, modern Airstream with a container house and nested it inside of an automated parking garage. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita In terms of mobility specifically, Kasita is a first of its kind. Wilson‚Äôs Model One prototype, which was recently unveiled at South By Southwest, is a sleek, simplistic glass-and-steel box that can get up and go when life says it‚Äôs time for a change. Each Kasita slides into an engineered steel exo-skeleton that can be built in under a week on any open lot in any city up to ten stories high (for now). If you need‚Äîor want‚Äîto move, your Kasita comes with you. Just power up you app, schedule your move from Austin to Chicago, and grab your duffle bag. A crane and a flatbed truck scheduled by Wilson‚Äôs team will take care of the rest. Packing? Forget about it. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs vision to provide ‚Äúattainable‚Äù, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster. ‚ÄúI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,‚Äù Wilson recalls. ‚ÄúI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster‚Äù. 'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita In early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson‚Äôs goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúun-American‚Äù; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson‚Äôs decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think. ‚ÄúMost nights I‚Äôd just stare at the dumpster ceiling,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúAnd one night I had the first of two ‚Äòa-ha‚Äô moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn‚Äôt own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding ‚Äúmicro housing‚Äù. When you say the word ‚Äúpre-manufactured‚Äù most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a ‚ÄúMurphy bed‚Äù the answer will simply be ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîbecause no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. ‚ÄúI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita When Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson‚Äôs first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn‚Äôt reinvent real estate through architecture alone. \"I told him, ‚ÄòI want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that‚Äôs like a Tesla to drive‚Äô\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing‚Äîand he didn't know much‚Äîand make something truly iconic.\" Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita The result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you‚Äôre on your way home ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to just make Kasita ‚Äòsmart‚Äô‚Äù, Wilson explains, ‚ÄúWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of ‚Äúreasonable housing‚Äù is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can‚Äôt attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta. Courtesy of Kasita ‚ÄúIt you really think about it,‚Äù Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There‚Äôs a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it‚Äôs tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn‚Äôt even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.‚Äù So what‚Äôs it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just put it this way,‚Äù Wilson tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.‚Äù But remember we‚Äôre talking about your house here."

    "description": "He lived in a dumpster, then designed a slick plug-and-play prefab that got stuck in permitting purgatory, but now Jeff Wilson, AKA \"Professor Dumpster,\" has released an ultra-nimble modular shelter that he believes could circumvent permits and deploys in just an hour (solar, water and all). And, he‚Äôs offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\n\nVideo on Kasita tiny prefab (Jeff's previous endeavor): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jF9ftC6U0Y\n\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. ‚ÄúArriving with all the essentials ‚Äòin the box‚Äô‚Äîincluding a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels, and backup batteries, and even the linens‚ÄîJupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,‚Äù explains Wilson. \n\nDespite its canvas cladding, Wilson calls it ‚Äúmore a device than a tent: Jupe‚Äôs units are built on an innovative ‚Äúchassis‚Äù foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.‚Äù This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so ‚Äúpermits are rarely necessary‚Äù. \n\nWilson says it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living, currently, they are ideal for not only short-term rentals but as popup disaster relief shelter. \n\nOn the ‚ÄúSlow Coast‚Äù of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\n\nTo rent your land & partner with Jupe: https://jupe.com/partner\nWallace J.

    "content": "More From Forbes Meet Kasita: The Micro-Housing Start-Up That's About To Revolutionize Real Estate You can tell immediately that Jeff Wilson, the 42-year old founder of Kasita, an Austin-based micro-housing start-up, has been courting venture capital. He has his sales pitch nailed‚Äîwhich is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster. When I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: ‚ÄúKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed. Kasita Founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \"Professor Dumpster\". Courtesy of Kasita Over the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It‚Äôs not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives‚Äîfrom banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation‚Äînow runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn‚Äôt moved an inch in 128 years? Seeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or ‚Äúsmall home‚Äù) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence. Courtesy of Kasita Broadly speaking, Wilson‚Äôs Kasita falls into the architectural category of prefabricated micro housing, sharing common themes with the tiny house movement like surgically efficient use of interior space and small-scale affordability. Conceptually, Kasita is what you‚Äôd end up with if you crossbred a chic, modern Airstream with a container house and nested it inside of an automated parking garage. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita In terms of mobility specifically, Kasita is a first of its kind. Wilson‚Äôs Model One prototype, which was recently unveiled at South By Southwest, is a sleek, simplistic glass-and-steel box that can get up and go when life says it‚Äôs time for a change. Each Kasita slides into an engineered steel exo-skeleton that can be built in under a week on any open lot in any city up to ten stories high (for now). If you need‚Äîor want‚Äîto move, your Kasita comes with you. Just power up you app, schedule your move from Austin to Chicago, and grab your duffle bag. A crane and a flatbed truck scheduled by Wilson‚Äôs team will take care of the rest. Packing? Forget about it. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs vision to provide ‚Äúattainable‚Äù, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster. ‚ÄúI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,‚Äù Wilson recalls. ‚ÄúI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster‚Äù. 'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita In early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson‚Äôs goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúun-American‚Äù; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson‚Äôs decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think. ‚ÄúMost nights I‚Äôd just stare at the dumpster ceiling,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúAnd one night I had the first of two ‚Äòa-ha‚Äô moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn‚Äôt own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding ‚Äúmicro housing‚Äù. When you say the word ‚Äúpre-manufactured‚Äù most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a ‚ÄúMurphy bed‚Äù the answer will simply be ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîbecause no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. ‚ÄúI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita When Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson‚Äôs first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn‚Äôt reinvent real estate through architecture alone. \"I told him, ‚ÄòI want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that‚Äôs like a Tesla to drive‚Äô\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing‚Äîand he didn't know much‚Äîand make something truly iconic.\" Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita The result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you‚Äôre on your way home ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to just make Kasita ‚Äòsmart‚Äô‚Äù, Wilson explains, ‚ÄúWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of ‚Äúreasonable housing‚Äù is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can‚Äôt attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta. Courtesy of Kasita ‚ÄúIt you really think about it,‚Äù Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There‚Äôs a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it‚Äôs tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn‚Äôt even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.‚Äù So what‚Äôs it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just put it this way,‚Äù Wilson tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.‚Äù But remember we‚Äôre talking about your house here."

    "content": "Meet the start-up founder who lived in a dumpster to help fix the homeownership crisis To truly understand what's its like to live small and comfortably, Jeff Wilson gave away most of his possessions and moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster. Now, he thinks he has a solution to dwindling homeownership rates. His startup Kasita makes 352-square-foot smart tiny homes that are packed to the brim with technology and storage space. He's showing off a Kasita model home at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. \"We're solving a very old, complex problem,\" said Wilson. \"Real estate is thousands of years old. Land is where old wealthy families store all their money. So it's a very locked down system. So what we say is where is where are the cracks in the system?\" Current U.S. homeownership rates have dropped to a historical low, mostly because millennials aren't buying houses. Saddled by college debt and rising home prices, many can't save up to make the downpayment on market-value houses. Wages aren't increasing and cities are building new housing to meet demand, Wilson adds. At $139,000 a unit ‚Äî which works out to a mortgage of about $800 a month plus land lease costs, according to Wilson ‚Äî he thinks many more people can afford to call a Kasita home. Wilson was previously a professor of environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. In 2014, he decided to see how much space people really needed to live comfortably. He sold most of his possessions, found a 6 foot X 5.5 foot dumpster, placed it on the university campus, and moved in with his few favorite items, including a handful of books and a few shirts. \"It was absolutely insane,\" Wilson admitted. \"I just wanted to try it for an experiment, what happens when you push the absolute limits of small and base level.\" \"Professor Dumpster\" lived in his repurposed home for about one year, save a few nights when he was traveling or staying with friends. But even though he learned ways to make the space seem larger like painting the walls white and creative storage hacks, there were still some things he couldn't fix. Architects and engineers couldn't figure out how to fit a kitchen and bathroom inside the dumpster. He resorted to using the dorm and school gym bathrooms. What Wilson learned was while 33 square feet might be too small, people could definitely downsize their living space in order to have more disposable income for traveling and other experiences.

    "content": "Meet the start-up founder who lived in a dumpster to help fix the homeownership crisis To truly understand what's its like to live small and comfortably, Jeff Wilson gave away most of his possessions and moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster. Now, he thinks he has a solution to dwindling homeownership rates. His startup Kasita makes 352-square-foot smart tiny homes that are packed to the brim with technology and storage space. He's showing off a Kasita model home at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. \"We're solving a very old, complex problem,\" said Wilson. \"Real estate is thousands of years old. Land is where old wealthy families store all their money. So it's a very locked down system. So what we say is where is where are the cracks in the system?\" Current U.S. homeownership rates have dropped to a historical low, mostly because millennials aren't buying houses. Saddled by college debt and rising home prices, many can't save up to make the downpayment on market-value houses. Wages aren't increasing and cities are building new housing to meet demand, Wilson adds. At $139,000 a unit ‚Äî which works out to a mortgage of about $800 a month plus land lease costs, according to Wilson ‚Äî he thinks many more people can afford to call a Kasita home. Wilson was previously a professor of environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. In 2014, he decided to see how much space people really needed to live comfortably. He sold most of his possessions, found a 6 foot X 5.5 foot dumpster, placed it on the university campus, and moved in with his few favorite items, including a handful of books and a few shirts. \"It was absolutely insane,\" Wilson admitted. \"I just wanted to try it for an experiment, what happens when you push the absolute limits of small and base level.\" \"Professor Dumpster\" lived in his repurposed home for about one year, save a few nights when he was traveling or staying with friends. But even though he learned ways to make the space seem larger like painting the walls white and creative storage hacks, there were still some things he couldn't fix. Architects and engineers couldn't figure out how to fit a kitchen and bathroom inside the dumpster. He resorted to using the dorm and school gym bathrooms. What Wilson learned was while 33 square feet might be too small, people could definitely downsize their living space in order to have more disposable income for traveling and other experiences. However, a house had to feel like a home and not make the person give up any conveniences. Sure, Kasita's are tiny at first glance. But, they come with ultra-modern amenities like Amazon Alexa-powered lighting modes and dynamic windows that have programmable tint modes, as well as a clever design that maximizes its space while giving you tons of storage options.

This work examined the ability of real-time reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms and rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) to approximate the spatiotemporal distribution of PCR-confirmed S-OIV cases for the purposes of focusing local intervention efforts. Cluster and age adjusted relative risk patterns of ILI, RIDT, and S-OIV were assessed at a fine spatial scale at different time and space extents within Cameron County, Texas on the US‚ÄìMexico border. Space‚Äìtime patterns of ILI and RIDT were found to effectively characterize the areas with highest geographical risk of S-OIV within the first two weeks of the outbreak. Based on these results, ILI and/or RIDT may prove to be acceptable indicators of the location of S-OIV hotspots. Given that S-OIV data is often difficult to obtain real-time during an outbreak; these findings may be of use to public health officials targeting prevention and response efforts during future flu outbreaks.

Its worth the watch! #Agtech #FoodSecurity #ClimateChangeMitigation https://lnkd.in/eh-xynSD Liz Walsh Climate change often focuses on reducing carbon emissions, but what about methane? Unlike carbon, which is a waste captured for disposal, methane holds untapped potential as energy that can be repurposed. Startup Windfall Bio‚Äôs solution intrigued me: Methane-eating microbes that convert emissions into fertilizer. They supply them to industries like agriculture, oil and gas, and landfills, where companies have the option to either use the fertilizer themselves or sell it for additional revenue. This not only offers a low-cost alternative to traditional carbon capture methods but also creates a near-term revenue stream for companies. While carbon reduction has long been the focus, methane's shorter lifespan (10-12 years) and potential for repurposing make it a promising avenue for immediate impact.

The built environment, responsible for a significant share of global emissions, offers a prime opportunity for innovation and sustainable development. This journey through the emerging opportunities in sheltertech investment has revealed a pressing need to bridge the gap between our climate ambitions and the realities of urban development. By prioritizing investments in affordable, sustainable housing technologies, we have the power to catalyze climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. This is not just about building homes; it's about reshaping our future towards a more sustainable and equitable world. Let's take this call to action seriously and leverage sheltertech as a pivotal arena for driving environmental sustainability and social well-being. For a deeper understanding and to explore the opportunities within sheltertech, I encourage you to check out the full report here: https://lnkd.in/eHrjw3c5 #Proptech #ShelterTech #Sustainability Rony Patishi-Chillim I am consistently reminded of the pivotal role the entire food chain and especially agriculture play when it comes to climate challenges. Agriculture players suffer from the impact of climate change in various aspects of their businesses (think weather for example), at the same time agriculture contributes negatively to climate change (soil health anyone?) and finally agriculture holds the potential to help mitigate climate effects (so many examples but carbon sequestration as an immediate one). It gets even more interesting when one considers the amazing technological tools that actively help transform this complex space. Interesting piece covering carbon sequestration challenges featuring our portfolio company Groundwork BioAg. Jack Levy MoreVC https://lnkd.in/dWy5FnZv Jamil Wyne Fantastic event (and ecosystem) that Patrick Meier, PhD and his team at the Climate Robotics Network are creating. Highly recommend you check out the Climate Robotics Summit, done in partnership with EPFL, SOSV, Cybernetix Ventures, ETH Z√ºrich, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I just had the pleasure of moderating a panel just now on investing in climate robotics, alongside Urvi Nagrani, Malini Samtani, Sashi Jayatileke and Fady Saad. Here are some of the key insights: 1) Applications for robotics to climate challenges (adaptation AND mitigation) are enormous: support to farmers as conditions for humans become too hot to farm for long hours, drones that help capture data on forests and wildlife, supporting with installation of maintenance in large solar fields, wind turbines, circular economy applications - e.g. de-manufacturing - to just name a few. 2) Investing in robotics is simply different - it doesn't fit the standard SAAS VC strategies, often having a lot of engineering input and require non-dilutive funding upfront - e.g. similar barriers to investing in hardware writ large. Thus, it sits in a bit of its own asset class, so investors and entrepreneurs alike need to understand how these solutions behave, esp. in the early-stages of building/testing. That said, there is a growing pool of funds that have been specializing in this area. 3) So how do we move robotics solutions up the TRL ladder faster? It can take a LONG time for any robotics solution to be truly market ready. Even when there is theoretical product-market fit doesn't mean that it's ready in investors' eyes. Lots of testing as well as setting proper expectations with customers is critical, and part of this long process. Non-dilutive funding is rare to find in most countries, but in the US in particular there is a growing pool of grant funding that can help. 4) Development finance institutions and donors have a critical role here, especially in vulnerable countries/communities: Robotics could have bit impact in supporting climate solutions in vulnerable communities, but we need to ensure that there is an enabling environment for these solutions, which means that the policy, academic, and traditional finance space (e.g. local commercial banks) Liz Walsh Let's talk #AgTech, and more specifically: sustainable rice farming. üåæ It's a staple crop for more than 1/2 the population. Yet traditional rice farming methods contribute significantly to methane emissions (it's nearly 30x as potent as carbon dioxide in warming the atmosphere). Water usage is significant too @ 20 million liters per hectare. NYC based Mitti Labs aims to slash methane emissions by 50% and cut water usage by 30%. As the second largest rice producer: #India is their primary market; a country facing imminent threats in water levels and methane. They plan to work with over 40,000 smallholder farmers by helping them adopt and implement sustainable farming techniques. With 10 more projects underway, they're expanding to Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam by 2025. Working with local partners is a key part of their strategy. üí∞ This is worth noting: Mitti Labs isn't just cutting environmental impact‚Äîthey're boosting farmers' incomes up to 30% via carbon credit sales. The tech looks like this: üåæ Mitti Labs buy high-res imagery using synthetic aperture radars from SAOCOM and Umbra, and fuse with satellite imagery to understand water level, soil moisture and plant growth, etc. üåæ They also capture methane and nitrous oxide fluxes coming out in the field, using greenhouse gas chambers on the ground. This chamber data is processed by third party labs via a software model in order to calculate emissions. üåæ On the carbon credit front: they worked with Cornell University, the International Rice Research Institute and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to test and experiment with satellite imagery, gas chamber data and advance measurement practices. Transforming traditional farming practices is a complex task. It will be interesting to see how effectively these solutions can be implemented & scaled. Mitti Labs initial round was co-led by Lightspeed and Voyager Ventures, and supported by Harvard Innovation Labs. #ClimateChange #ImpactInvesting #SustainableFarming Jagmeet Singh Andres Oberto The venture capital landscape for climate tech continues to show great promise. However, it is essential to gain a better understanding of climate tech timelines and adjust expectations accordingly. This understanding is crucial to meeting the significant capital needs of the sector and effectively transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Great article by Dasha Shunina https://lnkd.in/eiX-ZFpg Ben Stafford Landing back from #nyc and a great week at the Global AgInvesting conference, it‚Äôs clear that the weather has changed since last week and the presence of the winters #flooding has started to subside. When we ran a farming academy in Northumberland with the Understanding Ag, LLC - Experts in Regenerative Ag in October 2022, one of the profound comments was around the suitability for #agriculture and #regenerativeagriculture in the UK‚Äôs climate. Yesterday WIRED published an article on ‚Äòthe rise of the carbon farmer‚Äô which provides a positive lens on the potential impact of agriculture to sequester carbon. If soil health beneficial practices are used to generate regenerative outcomes. Quoting UK #organic farmer Patrick Holden. ‚ÄúMy farm‚Äôs been farmed organically for 51 years,‚Äù says Patrick Holden ‚ÄúI‚Äôve built up soil carbon, my operation is now carbon-negative‚Äîif I was to switch to intensive methods then theoretically I could burn up that carbon stock. But if I was paid to be a carbon steward, I‚Äôm not going to do that.‚Äù Having experienced one of the wettest winters on record, let‚Äôs not forget the value of slowing down and filtering water with #healthysoils.

Some call it the \"commercial valley of death.\" The assumption is that once climate tech solutions are proven, then industry/corporates will scale them. The reality is they're pressured to invest where there's immediate shareholder value. #mindthegap Prime Coalition‚Äôs Trellis Climate Program wants to bridge that gap. Here's how: üåçTapping Philanthropy: They take a unique approach by tapping into philanthropic funds to fuel high-impact projects during the middle stages, where traditional capital falls short. üåç Investing in Innovation: For climate tech founders, this funding model offers a ray of hope. While there are plenty of early-stage funding options, Trellis Climate fills a crucial gap by propelling proven technologies toward commercialization. üåèPhilanthropy as a Catalyst: By using philanthropic dollars as catalysts, they attract infrastructure investors willing to take calculated risks. Together, they pave the way for scalable climate solutions. Trellis Climate is getting started with investments in startups Ample Carbon and Ebb Carbon.

And, he‚Äôs offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\n\nVideo on Kasita tiny prefab (Jeff's previous endeavor): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jF9ftC6U0Y\n\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. ‚ÄúArriving with all the essentials ‚Äòin the box‚Äô‚Äîincluding a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels, and backup batteries, and even the linens‚ÄîJupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,‚Äù explains Wilson. \n\nDespite its canvas cladding, Wilson calls it ‚Äúmore a device than a tent: Jupe‚Äôs units are built on an innovative ‚Äúchassis‚Äù foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.‚Äù This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so ‚Äúpermits are rarely necessary‚Äù. \n\nWilson says it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living, currently, they are ideal for not only short-term rentals but as popup disaster relief shelter. \n\nOn the ‚ÄúSlow Coast‚Äù of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\n\nTo rent your land & partner with Jupe: https://jupe.com/partner\nWallace J.

    "title": "Kasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism",
    "description": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \"iPhone for housing\". He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a ‚Äúrack‚Äù to become part of ‚Äúa vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink about an RV park‚Äù, explains Wilson, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.‚Äù\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. ‚ÄúThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, permitting, and the land. And the land‚Äôs the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing homeownership to someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn‚Äôt a real estate firm, but a product company. They‚Äôre not just selling their ‚ÄúiPhones for housing‚Äù, but they‚Äôre selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own ‚Äúvertical, high-end, urban trailer park‚Äù.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country,  these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n‚ÄúSo folks aren‚Äôt going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let‚Äôs say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you‚Äôre no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that‚Äôs the way that the world is moving.‚Äù\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn‚Äôt released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n\nhttps://kasita.com/\nPhoto credit (dumpster): Sarah Natsumi\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kasita-tiny-prefab-home-as-a-service-for-post-land-urbanism",

To follow along, stay tuned for new video episodes on our Facebook page. This month‚Äôs location? A tiny prefab billed as the ‚ÄúiPhone for housing.‚Äù Tiny houses have long been a dwelling of choice for those who appreciate a minimalist lifestyle, but they‚Äôve become even more trendy in recent years after an ongoing affordable housing crisis (and, admittedly, HGTV‚Äôs House Hunters spinoff on the miniature homes). But tiny doesn‚Äôt have to mean it‚Äôs missing out on any special features of a futuristic home either. Kasita, an Austin-based startup, is hoping to fit all the latest tech into just 352 square feet of living space. In fact, the company calls its micro-homes the ‚ÄúiPhone for housing.‚Äù Kasita is outfitted with the latest voice-activated tech, so you can program your home to recognize ‚Äúmoods.‚Äù Tell Kasita to prepare for theater mode and it‚Äôll know to dim the lights, raise the flatscreen TV out from a hidden wall, and open your favorite streaming app. The model unit Kasita founder Jeff Wilson showed us has more than 60 smart home devices that are preprogrammed to talk to each other, and span areas including home security, indoor temperature, and even the shower room to help save water consumption. Wilson says to buy these devices separately, it would cost over $20,000, plus the amount of time it takes to connect the devices together under one system. Kasita‚Äôs turnkey micro-unit costs $139,000 with everything ready to go and controllable from the main Kasita app. The home isn‚Äôt just designed for those looking to live on remote land or strap the unit to their van and move around the country either. In dense, urban areas like Houston and Brooklyn, Kasita units can be stacked to create a tower of micro-apartments, or used as commercial space for tiny restaurants and shops. The company is currently working with local governments to pilot Kasita communities as an affordable housing solution. Earlier this year, the company opened a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in East Austin that can churn out a unit in just eight weeks.

Image: Kasita Kasita, an Austin startup founded in 2015 amid significant local and national buzz for its prefabricated ‚Äútiny smart home‚Äù concept, is officially no more. Rising in its place is Kasita, a new firm fashioned in the rough image of its predecessor, but with a notably different application imagined for the modular dwelling technology constituting the previous company‚Äôs legacy ‚Äî boutique hotel development, built one suite at a time. A rendering of Kasita‚Äôs planned flagship hotel project in the Austin area, which the company expects to launch in 2020. Though the firm can‚Äôt confirm its location for the moment, the site seen in the image appears to be the former site of the second planned Kimber Modern hotel on Elizabeth Street in South Austin. Image: Kasita The new startup, which shares no ownership with the previous company, is now described plainly on its site as a hospitality operation, and makes no bones about this radically different new identity. Though its predecessors managed to build an unspecified number of housing units, some of which can be found as accessory dwellings around Austin, the new Kasita will no longer sell tiny homes to consumers. The previous Kasita tiny house company was founded in 2015 with an ambitious vision. They created one of the most innovative and highly regarded tiny homes on the market. Unfortunately, there was not enough consumer demand to support their plan to manufacture and sell tiny homes directly to consumers, and the previous Kasita tiny house company ceased operations. ‚Äî Kasita.com An interior view of a Kasita suite. Image: Kasita It appears the design of the Kasita unit, previously described as ideal for prefabricated multifamily communities, works just as well in the context of a hotel. The new Kasita‚Äôs co-founders are self-described ‚Äúserial entrepreneurs‚Äù Kenny Tomlin and Richard Lent, who both have previous experience in this world ‚Äî Tomlin, also the CEO of commercial real estate firm Elevate Growth Partners, co-owns the Kimber Modern boutique hotel with Lent near South Congress Avenue‚Äôs entertainment district. Even without considering the minimalist design influences shared between the two, you might think of the seven-room Kimber as a testbed for the type of experience Kasita‚Äôs hotels appear designed to deliver ‚Äî with check-ins, keyless entry, and communication with staff all conducted via email and text message, a low-impact approach shared by boutique newcomers like Arrive East Austin.

Given its modular design, the key count for a Kasita hotel project should scale to the needs and constraints of a given site, its units linked by shared common spaces. Interior images of a Kasita unit in its original residential configuration (left) and its hotel suite design (right). Images: Kasita Kasita‚Äôs business model, assuming it‚Äôs successfully implemented, opens up some interesting land-use opportunities. Not unlike a food truck park occupying a vacant property until the financial stars align for the site‚Äôs development somewhere down the road, a Kasita hotel would temporarily activate and monetize empty lots that might otherwise sit vacant for years as part of an owner‚Äôs land-banking scheme. For landowners, Kasita offers the opportunity to activate luxury hospitality on their properties in a fraction of the time and at a cost savings of up to 50% compared to conventional projects. Kasitas are permanent structures but are precision built in a factory and can be moved opportunistically at a low cost. This unlocks land-banking opportunities and the ability to ‚Äútuck in‚Äù Kasitas at existing destinations like wineries with minimal disruption. ‚Äî Kasita.com In their previous lives as homes, Kasita units could be easily transported and placed via flatbed truck and crane, and the new hotel use likely hasn‚Äôt changed this feature ‚Äî meaning these hotels could pop up quickly and leave just as fast, which the company says could cut development costs in half compared with traditional construction. A rendering of a communal outdoor amenity space at a Kasita hotel. Image: Kasita Though the demise of the original Kasita dwelling concept is disappointing, it‚Äôs not a complete surprise ‚Äî the individual unit cost remained higher than what the market for this asset class would support. As an income-generating hotel platform, however, the benefits of its striking design and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technology seem a bit more obvious. With the new Kasita expecting to launch its flagship Austin location in 2020, we‚Äôll soon find out whether the startup‚Äôs second life sticks around.

The Austin-based company is at the ULI Spring Meeting in Detroit meeting with developers and showing off a prototype of its 352-square-foot home. Modular-home manufacturer Kasita‚Äôs units range from 352 to 408 square feet (33 to 38 sq m) and prices start at about $90,000. (Courtesy of Kasita) Micro-housing builder Kasita is making its first appearance at a ULI event during the 2018 Spring Meeting in Detroit, as it ramps up marketing to developers for its next-generation approach to modular home construction. ‚ÄúThis is where construction is going,‚Äù said Benji Miller, Kasita‚Äôs chief operating officer, as he lounged in a Kasita prototype parked outside the Cobo Center. ‚ÄúWe take a lot of the risk out of the process.‚Äù The Kasita unit is available for ULI Spring Meeting attendees to tour, providing a glimpse into how Kasita has reengineered a living environment, including a kitchen, washing machine, and bathroom with shower. Kasita‚Äôs units range from 352 to 408 square feet (33 to 38 sq m) and prices start at about $90,000. Two designs are available: the Independent, a stand-alone accessory dwelling unit, and Community, a ‚Äúmodular, stackable, high-density product for real estate developers, institutions, governments, and anyone who wants to place multiple units in tight urban spaces,‚Äù according to company marketing materials. Units priced at $109,000 are shipped fully equipped with appliances and furniture, including a queen-size bed that slides away to create more living space. Storage space is also available under the floor or in optional cabinets. Each unit is wired for an Alexa-like home assistant to control lights and appliances. Eleven-foot-high (3.4 m) ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and elevated spaces are designed to give the units the look and feel of a larger space. While companies have been pitching modular concepts for decades, rising construction and labor costs make prefab more enticing for developers, the company says. ‚ÄúWe think the time is right for this,‚Äù said Dason Whitsett, the principal architect. Construction in a ‚Äúcontrolled factory environment is not subject to the whims of the market,‚Äù he said. Standardized and tightly controlled manufacturing can eliminate many of the past problems that builders have experienced using modular designs, Miller says. No welding is required in the process of site prep, he says. ‚ÄúWe have spent a lot of time looking at framing and production,‚Äù Miller says. Some of Kasita‚Äôs models come fully furnished with convertible furniture hooked up to Amazon‚Äôs Alexa voice assistant system. (Courtesy of Kasita) Work is expected to begin later this year on a mixed-use, 24-unit project in Denver. The company also has a commitment for a project in New York, Miller says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre hitting places that are being hit hard by the housing crisis and the lack of supply of housing,‚Äù Matt McPheely, the company‚Äôs head of sales, told the Denver Post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking a manufacturing approach to housing, which enables high precision and scalability.‚Äù In California, the company has been touting the use of the units for granny flats, but the company‚Äôs focus is on larger projects. Four to five stories is the ideal height for projects, the executives say. ‚ÄúThe assumption is we are a tiny home,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúWe are really a modular builder.‚Äù Kasita founder Jeff Wilson famously spent a year living in a 33-square-foot (3 sq m) Dumpster ‚Äúto test the limits of habitable space,‚Äù according to the company‚Äôs website. The two-year-old firm has raised $11.2 million in investments, including support from Gary Keller, the founder of Keller Williams, the residential brokerage firm.

Kasitas that would be based on the 352-square-foot prototype parked on an East Austin lot were projected to cost around $139,000 (which didn‚Äôt include purchasing the land they would stand on, of course‚Äîalthough at the time changes in Austin‚Äôs zoning ordinances were starting make the more widespread use of accessory dwelling units on residential properties possible). By 2017, Kasita was a national phenomenon‚Äîat least in the press, think tanks, and the academy‚Äîif not yet one that was actually producing and selling a lot of its streamlined, modern tiny homes. Touted as the ‚ÄúiPhone for housing‚Äù (it was 2017), the Kasita model and its touted revolutionary potential were featured, praised, and debated in multiple media sources, including CityLab and the New York Times. Its tours, collaborations, and activations during SXSW were big hits for a couple of years. Curbed and the Verge even produced and aired a video about Kasita for their Home of the Future series. Throughout 2017 and into 2018, the company continued to announce advances such as moving to a stackable version of its modular units that would be more affordable than the originals, expansion to other states, and the start of production in its own manufacturing facility. Around the start of 2019, the buzz around Kasita quieted considerably, and, if LinkedIn is any indication, Williams‚Äôs tenure as CEO seems to have ended late last year. A post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on Nov 8, 2018 at 5:02am PST By June, Kasitas were appearing on the MLS, brokered by real estate professionals, not the company. According to the company‚Äôs new website, ‚Äúserial entrepreneurs‚Äù Kenny Tomlin and Richard Lent‚Äîwho also own the Kimber Modern boutique hotel in South Austin‚Äîbecame co-owners of Kasita in early 2019.

Individual Kasitas are now hotel suites, intended to be grouped and operated as a sort of hotel compound, with guests staying in individual, detached units rather than a single building. Guests will use various technologies come and go independent of any staff‚Äînot unlike the intended independent, tech-based experience at the newly opened Arrive East Austin‚Äîalthough there will be common areas available to guests as well.

The micro-housing startup called Kasita ‚Äì adapted from the Spanish word for a small house ‚Äì was launched by a professor-turned-entrepreneur who once lived in a dumpster. At the South by Southwest conference in March 2016, the company unveiled its first dwelling: the 319-square-foot (30 square metres) Model One house. The mobile structure is a rectilinear pod clad in metal and glass, with one side featuring a cantilevered glazed box. It is intended to slot horizontally into an engineered steel frame, or \"rack\", which can include many units stacked high and wide. Designed to be assembled in under a week, each Kasita would be able to swap between different racks. Owners with mobile lifestyles could contact the company to have the home transported to a new location, using a crane and flatbed truck. Once in place, the home would tie into city utilities via a special docking technology. \"The utilities are distributed throughout the rack to each individual Kasita,\" the company said. The house would come equipped with smart-home technology that can be controlled by a mobile app. Related story Harvard students create tiny vacation houses for stressed-out city dwellers Features include a smart thermostat by Nest ‚Äì the domestic technology company that Google acquired in 2014 ‚Äì and a voice-controlled Echo speaker by Amazon. The design also calls for wireless LED lighting system and electrochromic windows that automatically turn from opaque to transparent, depending upon the outdoor lighting conditions. The open-plan interior has 10-foot-high ceilings (three metres). The kitchen offers standard amenities such as a dishwasher, an induction cooktop and a convection oven, while the sleeping area is fitted with a queen-sized mattress. The company is working to develop wall panels that will accommodate shelving, bike racks and storage. \"Kasita is designed for a variety of individuals at different places in their life,\" the company said. \"From college kids in need of student housing, to urban millennials, to those enjoying retirement ‚Äì Kasita is the perfect home.\" The company hopes to attract developers, who can purchase multiple units and stack them up to 10 stories high. \"Not only are Kasita homes for individuals, or the answer for the urban housing crisis, but Kasitas can also serve as rapid-reusable crisis housing, event housing or a space to have the grandparents closer to the kids,\" the company said. \"We're still dreaming up the ways they'll be used.\" The company was founded by Jeff Wilson, a former environmental studies professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin. Wilson spent several years working for IBM in California in the last 1990s, during the dot-com boom. For a year, from 2014 to 2015, Wilson lived in a modified trash dumpster in Austin, which led him to start Kasita. Called The Dumpster Project, the experiment was meant to explore sustainable practises and new ways of living. \"Small living led Wilson to reimagine what a comfortable home could be ‚Äì especially in a growing city in need of affordable, urban housing,\" Kasita states on its website. \"He took all the best elements of dumpster life ‚Äì more from less, beautiful design, and smart technology ‚Äì and conceptualised a dream space.\" The company intends to start taking orders from customers this year, according to its website. Pricing has not yet been released. This animation demonstrates the concept behind Kasita's micro-home startup Kasita is part of a growing tiny-house movement, which advocates living simply in small structures. Other micro dwellings include cabins designed by Harvard students for stressed-out city dwellers and a pair of wooden dwellings in a Japanese village. A San Francisco-based company recently unveiled a prefabricated tiny house that comes shipped to the site in flat-packed boxes. Photography is by Andrea Calo.

Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4] Jupe In 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5] Kasita Wilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas. The Dumpster Project Wilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6] \"No Baggage\" experiment Together with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43] 99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment Subsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45] Academic Work Wilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston‚ÄìTillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48] References"

    "content": "A man was inspired to create tiny homes after living in a dumpster Meet Jeff Wilson: a former IBM project manager and dean at Huston-Tillotson University, who also happened to live in a dumpster for a year. What started as a project on minimalist living and sustainability developed into KASITA, Wilson's company that is making high-tech, moveable homes. Scroll down for more of Wilson's story and a closer look at KASITA housing. Wilson started off working for IBM during the dot-com boom, but quickly became frustrated with the corporate grind. After burying his Rolex in the desert, Wilson eventually found himself as a dean of a university with the novel concept of living in a dumpster. \"The idea was to test the absolute limits of what one needs to have a pretty good life,\" Wilson told Tech Insider. \"And although it wasn‚Äôt originally aimed at housing, the idea around housing evolved from it.\" So Wilson sold the majority of his possessions for a dollar a pop, getting the word out by posting a Facebook message his students could see. He showered at the University and fit the rest of his personal belongings in a backpack. \"One night, lying on my back in the dumpster staring up at the stars as we all do, I had that 'aha' dumpster epiphany, if you will,\" he said. \"There was something here to solve for one of our country‚Äôs biggest problems.\" So Wilson set off to design KASITA ‚Äî a 208-square-foot home that can easily be set up and moved anywhere. It has a bathroom, a kitchenette, study, and a lounge. There's also a tucked away queen-sized bed that comes with a Casper mattress. But the KASITA homes also come with high-tech perks, like a Nest thermostat, Amazon Echo, and special glass developed by SageGlass that changes shade based on how bright it is outside so you don't need blinds. The homes also comes with Philip Hue Lighting that lets you control the color and intensity of your lights using an app. All of the technology included in the home will be integrated into a central, KASITA app so it's easy to control your home's settings, Wilson said. A lot of the features can also be operated using voice command, he added. \"What I wanted to do was design, essentially, an iPhone that you could live in,\" Wilson said. \"Something that‚Äôs beautifully designed, mass manufacturable, [and] affordable to a much wider group of people than the traditional thing you would see.\" The KASITA homes will be sold directly to consumers in the Fall, but Wilson declined to give a specific date as to when they'll be available. As for price? \"It will be about the price of a mid-range Tesla, except this is a home,\" Wilson said. He declined to give a specific price, but the lowest price for a Tesla is the $35,000 Model 3. Wilson said KASITA will work with buyers to find and purchase the land to place their KASITA homes. \"What we ended up with is a new way of thinking about the home as more like a product than a pile of bricks and sticks stuck to a particular piece of land,\" he said. \"Something that‚Äôs more personal, that you know, that knows you, that integrates more with the person that you are.\" Read next Jump to"

    "content": "More From Forbes Meet Kasita: The Micro-Housing Start-Up That's About To Revolutionize Real Estate You can tell immediately that Jeff Wilson, the 42-year old founder of Kasita, an Austin-based micro-housing start-up, has been courting venture capital. He has his sales pitch nailed‚Äîwhich is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster. When I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: ‚ÄúKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed. Kasita Founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \"Professor Dumpster\". Courtesy of Kasita Over the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It‚Äôs not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives‚Äîfrom banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation‚Äînow runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn‚Äôt moved an inch in 128 years? Seeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or ‚Äúsmall home‚Äù) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence. Courtesy of Kasita Broadly speaking, Wilson‚Äôs Kasita falls into the architectural category of prefabricated micro housing, sharing common themes with the tiny house movement like surgically efficient use of interior space and small-scale affordability. Conceptually, Kasita is what you‚Äôd end up with if you crossbred a chic, modern Airstream with a container house and nested it inside of an automated parking garage. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita In terms of mobility specifically, Kasita is a first of its kind. Wilson‚Äôs Model One prototype, which was recently unveiled at South By Southwest, is a sleek, simplistic glass-and-steel box that can get up and go when life says it‚Äôs time for a change. Each Kasita slides into an engineered steel exo-skeleton that can be built in under a week on any open lot in any city up to ten stories high (for now). If you need‚Äîor want‚Äîto move, your Kasita comes with you. Just power up you app, schedule your move from Austin to Chicago, and grab your duffle bag. A crane and a flatbed truck scheduled by Wilson‚Äôs team will take care of the rest. Packing? Forget about it. Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs vision to provide ‚Äúattainable‚Äù, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster. ‚ÄúI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,‚Äù Wilson recalls. ‚ÄúI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster‚Äù. 'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita In early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson‚Äôs goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúun-American‚Äù; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson‚Äôs decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think. ‚ÄúMost nights I‚Äôd just stare at the dumpster ceiling,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúAnd one night I had the first of two ‚Äòa-ha‚Äô moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn‚Äôt own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Wilson‚Äôs second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding ‚Äúmicro housing‚Äù. When you say the word ‚Äúpre-manufactured‚Äù most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a ‚ÄúMurphy bed‚Äù the answer will simply be ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîbecause no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. ‚ÄúI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,‚Äù Wilson recalls, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.‚Äù Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita When Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson‚Äôs first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn‚Äôt reinvent real estate through architecture alone. \"I told him, ‚ÄòI want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that‚Äôs like a Tesla to drive‚Äô\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing‚Äîand he didn't know much‚Äîand make something truly iconic.\" Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita Courtesy of Kasita The result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you‚Äôre on your way home ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to just make Kasita ‚Äòsmart‚Äô‚Äù, Wilson explains, ‚ÄúWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.‚Äù Wilson‚Äôs other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of ‚Äúreasonable housing‚Äù is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can‚Äôt attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita ‚Äúcommunities‚Äù are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta. Courtesy of Kasita ‚ÄúIt you really think about it,‚Äù Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There‚Äôs a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it‚Äôs tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn‚Äôt even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.‚Äù So what‚Äôs it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just put it this way,‚Äù Wilson tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.‚Äù But remember we‚Äôre talking about your house here."

    "title": "Kasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism",
    "description": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \"iPhone for housing\". He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a ‚Äúrack‚Äù to become part of ‚Äúa vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park‚Äù. ‚ÄúThink about an RV park‚Äù, explains Wilson, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.‚Äù\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. ‚ÄúThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, permitting, and the land. And the land‚Äôs the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing homeownership to someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn‚Äôt a real estate firm, but a product company. They‚Äôre not just selling their ‚ÄúiPhones for housing‚Äù, but they‚Äôre selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own ‚Äúvertical, high-end, urban trailer park‚Äù.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country,  these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n‚ÄúSo folks aren‚Äôt going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let‚Äôs say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you‚Äôre no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that‚Äôs the way that the world is moving.‚Äù\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn‚Äôt released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n\nhttps://kasita.com/\nPhoto credit (dumpster): Sarah Natsumi\n\nOn *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kasita-tiny-prefab-home-as-a-service-for-post-land-urbanism",

And, he‚Äôs offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\n\nVideo on Kasita tiny prefab (Jeff's previous endeavor): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jF9ftC6U0Y\n\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. ‚ÄúArriving with all the essentials ‚Äòin the box‚Äô‚Äîincluding a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels, and backup batteries, and even the linens‚ÄîJupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,‚Äù explains Wilson. \n\nDespite its canvas cladding, Wilson calls it ‚Äúmore a device than a tent: Jupe‚Äôs units are built on an innovative ‚Äúchassis‚Äù foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.‚Äù This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so ‚Äúpermits are rarely necessary‚Äù. \n\nWilson says it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living, currently, they are ideal for not only short-term rentals but as popup disaster relief shelter. \n\nOn the ‚ÄúSlow Coast‚Äù of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\n\nTo rent your land & partner with Jupe: https://jupe.com/partner\nWallace J.

    "content": "Meet the start-up founder who lived in a dumpster to help fix the homeownership crisis To truly understand what's its like to live small and comfortably, Jeff Wilson gave away most of his possessions and moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster. Now, he thinks he has a solution to dwindling homeownership rates. His startup Kasita makes 352-square-foot smart tiny homes that are packed to the brim with technology and storage space. He's showing off a Kasita model home at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. \"We're solving a very old, complex problem,\" said Wilson. \"Real estate is thousands of years old. Land is where old wealthy families store all their money. So it's a very locked down system. So what we say is where is where are the cracks in the system?\" Current U.S. homeownership rates have dropped to a historical low, mostly because millennials aren't buying houses. Saddled by college debt and rising home prices, many can't save up to make the downpayment on market-value houses. Wages aren't increasing and cities are building new housing to meet demand, Wilson adds. At $139,000 a unit ‚Äî which works out to a mortgage of about $800 a month plus land lease costs, according to Wilson ‚Äî he thinks many more people can afford to call a Kasita home. Wilson was previously a professor of environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. In 2014, he decided to see how much space people really needed to live comfortably. He sold most of his possessions, found a 6 foot X 5.5 foot dumpster, placed it on the university campus, and moved in with his few favorite items, including a handful of books and a few shirts. \"It was absolutely insane,\" Wilson admitted. \"I just wanted to try it for an experiment, what happens when you push the absolute limits of small and base level.\" \"Professor Dumpster\" lived in his repurposed home for about one year, save a few nights when he was traveling or staying with friends. But even though he learned ways to make the space seem larger like painting the walls white and creative storage hacks, there were still some things he couldn't fix. Architects and engineers couldn't figure out how to fit a kitchen and bathroom inside the dumpster. He resorted to using the dorm and school gym bathrooms. What Wilson learned was while 33 square feet might be too small, people could definitely downsize their living space in order to have more disposable income for traveling and other experiences. However, a house had to feel like a home and not make the person give up any conveniences. Sure, Kasita's are tiny at first glance. But, they come with ultra-modern amenities like Amazon Alexa-powered lighting modes and dynamic windows that have programmable tint modes, as well as a clever design that maximizes its space while giving you tons of storage options. For example, a small staircase can be pulled out like a dresser, while the queen-sized bed completely tucks under the kitchen floor when not in use. \"This is a 12,000-pound piece of hardware filled with software,\" Wilson said. \"I don't think the Internet of Things are really useful until it becomes the Internet of experience.\" The pods are portable with a crane, and can be placed anywhere. Wilson sees a future where people can rent spaces on parking structures or stack Kasita's in premium spaces to take advantage of great location. And, Wilson is embracing the small lifestyle permanently. After SXSW, he plans to move into into the model Kasita with his partner. He's downsized his possessions even more. He's down to one shirt. \"You're lucky you caught me on the day after I dry cleaned it,\" he joked.

    "content": "Jeff Wilson Designs a Tiny Home By Magaly Grosso | Published on April 4, 2017 This small house (with a mere 32 meters squared) is a clear example of a well-distributed space. Even with such a small area, it‚Äôs perfectly possible to organize all the essentials. Designed by Jeff Wilson, the Tiny House has a solution for every problem. The convertible furniture allows us to set up the space depending on the circumstances. A sofa by day, and a bed by night. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-210611\" src=\"https://cdn.homedsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tiny-House-02-850x565.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://cdn.homedsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tiny-House-02.jpg 850w, https://cdn.homedsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tiny-House-02-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /> In the back of the living room/bedroom, we‚Äôll find glass walls that run from the floor to the ceiling, allowing natural light to enter the space. It also saves the area from feeling claustrophobic. In the kitchen, we‚Äôll find all the commodities we‚Äôve come to expect from a modern kitchen, including electric appliances. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-210619\" src=\"https://cdn.homedsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tiny-House-06-850x1143.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"1143\" /> The stairs also serve as storage compartments, specifically as a closet. Just another example of how intricately designed this home is. Just outside the bathroom, we‚Äôll find a closet along the hallway that leads us to the living room. Its shelves and space allow us to comfortably house our clothes here. A small space, adequately used to its full potential, is perfectly capable of granting us all the luxuries we‚Äôve come to know and love in a home. Once we enter, we‚Äôre greeted by a small, but adequately equipped, bathroom. Shower, toilet, and vanity all included. <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-210607\" src=\"https://cdn.homedsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tiny-House-11-850x421.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"421\" /> About Magaly Grosso Magaly Grosso was born in Venezuela where she grew up and studied Advertising and Marketing.

Professor Wilson, otherwise known as Dr. Dumpster, resides in a modern dumpster behind the women‚Äôs dorm at Huston-Tillotson University. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) At Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he‚Äôs lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster. Transcript CURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it‚Äôs hardly the kind of home you‚Äôd expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster ‚Äì a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he‚Äôs Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, ‚ÄúProfessor Dumpster?‚Äù WILSON: I‚Äôll take Professor Dumpster and you‚Äôre at my disposal. CURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have? WILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet. Professor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore) CURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics? WILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis. CURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come? WILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that‚Äôs the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well. Dr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you? WILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster. CURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home? Professor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore) WILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home. CURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing? WILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV. Egress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going? WILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic. [LAUGHS] Professor Wilson‚Äôs students peek in through the dumpster‚Äôs ‚Äúwindow‚Äù. (Photo: Jeff Wilson) CURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster? WILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests‚Äîand these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we‚Äôve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of ‚Äúcouch-surfing‚Äù itself, dumpster-surfing. CURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you. WILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick. CURWOOD: Ooooh. WILSON: [LAUGHS] CURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish? WILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it‚Äîthat you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be‚Äîas some have suggested Obama's new housing plan‚Äîas long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal. CURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover. WILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you‚Äôre around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by. CURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.

    "content": "Now 76 Thu 95 Fri 95 Austin micro-housing company taking first reservations at SXSW by Bettie Cross and Photojournalist Brian Bell An Austin man who spent a year living in a dumpster is taking what he learned about tiny homes to South by Southwest. Jeff Wilson or \"Professor Dumpster\" won the Innovation Award at last year's SXSW. This year his company, Kasita, was named Biggest Product Launch. The professor is hoping exposure at SXSW will help him turn micro-housing into a mainstream lifestyle. Jeff Wilson thinks big, but lives small. He's the kind of guy who could almost pack everything he owns in one box. Which makes it handy when you're on the move from the last year‚Äôs prototype of a tiny home to a tricked out, tech-stuffed living capsule. ‚ÄúSo we've got an extremely spacious kitchen here,‚Äù said Wilson, CEO of Kasita. Wilson has spent the past year evolving his micro housing concept. Less is more are words he's lived by since he took on the title of ‚ÄúProfessor Dumpster‚Äù in 2014. ‚ÄúI lived in a dumpster,‚Äù said Wilson. ‚ÄúIt was 33 square feet.‚Äù Which makes his new tiny home floor plan of 352 square feet feel seem almost ridiculously large. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a McMansion,‚Äù said Wilson. The CEO is living large in a glass and steel box where stairs hide storage and a couch doubles as a queen-size bed. But it's the smart home tech that makes 352 square feet so livable. ‚ÄúTap Date Night,‚Äù said Wilson pointing to a smart tablet. ‚ÄúThen the lights come down and the music gets going.‚Äù You can also tap Movie Time and a hidden TV slides up from behind storage drawers. Tap Bedtime and the smart technology turns off the lights and dims the dynamic glass in the windows. Smart home tech is incorporated into every room bringing the total cost of a Kasita to $139,000. The first reservations are being taken during SXSW. ‚ÄúIt's folks that want to live more of life traveling or eating out or living in the city with access to things,‚Äù said Wilson. Production is limited to 700 Kasitas a year that will be built in a North Austin factory. The first one is already taken. ‚ÄúThis is going to be my new crib,‚Äù said Wilson."

A project engineer at PCL Construction, Lizette Galvez (Construction Management ‚Äô21) recently collaborated with the Cal Poly Women in Construction Club to host Cal Poly V.E.S.T. (Verifying Everyone‚Äôs Safety Together) Hackathon. She feels that construction wear still operates to a one-size-fits-all standard, creating discomfort and a safety hazard. Galvez witnessed this herself when her oversized safety vest was caught on a piece of construction equipment. With help from colleagues, she collected data to prove this was a common occurrence and initiated a hackathon, where student and professional teams had two days to deconstruct a vest. The winning design was a vest that featured weight distribution with adjustable straps on the inside, vertical zippers for more access points, and a higher-up back pocket for better ergonomics in addition to tool-specific storage.

The Economic Value of Health Benefits Associated with Urban Park Investment Associated Data Data are contained within the article or Supplementary Materials. No new data were created. Abstract The allocation of resources towards the development and enhancement of urban parks offers an effective strategy for promoting and improving the health and well-being of urban populations. Investments in urban parks can result in a multitude of health benefits. The increased usage of greenspace by park users has been linked to positive physical and mental health outcomes. Additionally, the expansion of greenspace in urban areas can mitigate harmful impacts from air pollutants, heat, noise, and climate-related health risks. While the health benefits attributed to urban parks and greenspaces are well documented, few studies have measured the economic value of these benefits. This study applied a novel ecohealth economic valuation framework to quantify and estimate the potential economic value of health benefits attributed to the development of a proposed park in the downtown core of Peterborough, Canada. The results indicated that development of the small urban park will result in annual benefits of CAD 133,000 per year, including CAD 109,877 in the avoided economic burden of physical inactivity, CAD 23,084 in health savings associated with improved mental health, and CAD 127 in health savings attributed to better air quality. When including the economic value of higher life satisfaction, the economic benefit is more than CAD 4 million per year. The study demonstrates the value of developing and enhancing urban parks as a strategy to improve population health and well-being, and as a means of cost savings to the medical system. 1. Introduction Urban parks offer opportunities for engagement with the natural environment, and provide ecosystem services that contribute to positive health outcomes. Such opportunities include play, physical exercise and athletic activities, relaxation, social interaction, and reprieve from urban noise and heat. In addition, ecosystem services and vegetation cover from parks mitigate air pollutants, reduce surface temperatures and the urban heat island effect, mitigate flooding, support biodiversity, and increase community resiliency to climate change [1,2,3,4]. Urban parks include forested and vegetated areas, playgrounds, recreational fields, community gardens, and urban squares. Park investments can include developing new parks or expanding parks, improving the quality of parks and amenities, or offering new programs and services. Park investments provide health benefits by increasing the number of park users, influencing how users engage with parks, and increasing the amount of greenspace within an urban area to reduce the negative impacts from air pollutants, heat, noise, and climate-related health risks. The health benefits result in economic savings associated with reduced burden of illness, decreased use of health services, and higher life satisfaction. The economic framework and case study application presented in this study connects investments in urban parks to improvements in health and well-being to show the health return on investment. Making these connections helps policy makers, public health officials, and urban planners better understand and communicate the health value provided by urban parks in monetary terms. The results support program-, policy-, and planning-related decisions by complementing other factors and information under consideration. This study will be of interest to municipal policy makers, urban planners, parks departments, community health organizations, public health agencies, and sports and recreation groups, as the monetary value of health benefits provided by urban parks are typically omitted in the planning and budgeting process. The identification of quantifiable health outcomes associated with urban parks is a complex task due to a multitude of factors. These include the variety of exposures to different types, doses, and qualities of the environment, as well as the presence of mediators and modifiers, which can obscure causal relationships [1,4,5,6]. Additionally, measuring long-term health outcomes poses further challenges. Despite these complexities, the evidence linking urban parks to health outcomes is strongest in three key areas. These include physical health improvements, such as higher levels of physical activity; mental health improvements associated with exposure to nature; and improvements in respiratory symptoms and cardiovascular disease linked to reduced exposure to air pollution. Therefore, the application of the novel ecohealth economic framework emphasizes these three areas. Given the context of the study, the literature highlighted below focuses on the role of urban parks in facilitating higher levels of physical activity; supporting mental well-being; and improving air quality. For comprehensive reviews of the health benefits attributed to greenspace use and exposure, see [1,4,5,7,8]. 1.1. Higher Levels of Physical Activity One of the most extensively researched links between urban park exposure and improved health and well-being outcomes is through increased physical activity [1,7,9,10,11]. Physical activity can protect against a range of diseases and adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, hypertension, obesity, depression, osteoporosis, and premature death [12,13,14,15]. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies physical inactivity as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality [4]. In the context of urban parks and greenspaces, studies have consistently revealed a positive association between park exposure and increased physical activity, often determined by adherence to recommended physical activity guidelines [1,7,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Research conducted on North American urban parks indicates that the percentage of park users engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) varies from 18% to 62% [22,23,24]. Factors influencing the intensity and frequency of park users engaging in physical activities include neighbourhood demographics, socio-economic conditions, park proximity, park size, park amenities, park programs, and perceived security [7]. Numerous studies have shown that proximity to parks and neighbourhoods with higher amounts of urban greenspace are positively associated with higher levels of engagement in physical activity [9,10,11,12,13,14]. A study by Villeneuve et al., examining recreational physical activities in Ottawa, Canada, based on neighbourhood greenness using a Google Street View greenness index, found that those living in areas scoring in the upper quartile on the index spent on average 5.4 more hours weekly on recreational physical activities relative to those in the lowest quartile [15]. The presence of park amenities and park programming influence how people use parks, including the type of activity, activity duration, and activity intensity [13,16,17,18]. In a study of 33 parks in Ontario, Canada, Kaczynski et al. found that a greater number of both facilities (e.g., paths, trails, playgrounds, and basketball courts) and amenities (e.g., bike racks, historical or educational features, shelters, restrooms, and drinking fountains) were significantly associated with increased odds of physical activities in a park [9]. 1.2. Improved Mental Well-Being While the effects of parks on mental health are in part attributed to exercise, numerous studies indicate that simply spending time in parks, regardless of activity, contributes to lower levels of stress and higher levels of self-reported life satisfaction, happiness, and feelings that life is worthwhile [19,20,21,22,23]. Pfeiffer and colleagues noted that parks promote subjective well-being by providing a natural space in which visitors may enjoy opportunities for engagement, socializing, and exercise [24]. Their study in metropolitan Phoenix found that people who had greater perceived neighbourhood park access reported higher life satisfaction. Each additional acre of parks within the neighbourhood increased residents‚Äô life satisfaction score by 0.007 on a 1‚Äì5 scale measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). In an Australian longitudinal study, Wood and colleagues found that the presence of a neighbourhood open space, which serves as the recreational and social focus of a community, leads to an increase of 0.15 points on the Warwick‚ÄìEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) (on a 14‚Äì70 continuous scale) [25]. While the dynamics between park features, distances to parks, frequencies of visits, and durations of time spent in parks are not clear, park exposure has been shown to reduce incidences of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, as well as decrease mood disorder medication use and increase attention [19,21,22,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]. In a cohort study of 46,786 participants in Australia, Astell-Burt and Feng found lower rates of psychological distress in participants who spent time in greenspace, especially areas with trees [33]. A study by White and colleagues that examined associations between green/blue spaces and mental health across 18 countries found that the frequency of visits was positively associated with the World Health Organization‚Äôs five-item well-being index (WHO-5), negatively associated with the likelihood of mental distress, and negatively associated with the likelihood of using depression medication [34]. In an ecological cross-sectional study of census tracts in New York City, Yoo and colleagues found that as the proximity to urban greenspace increased, the standardized rate of emergency room visits related to all mental disorders (SRER) decreased [35]. They also noted that as canopy cover levels increased, SRER visits tended to decrease. Shanahan and colleagues conducted a study demonstrating that depression, high blood pressure, social cohesion, and physical activity are associated with both the frequency and duration of visits to greenspace [36]. Longer visits to greenspace were found to be correlated with reduced rates of depression and high blood pressure, while those who visited more frequently reported higher levels of social cohesion. A dose‚Äìresponse analysis for depression and high blood pressure suggested that weekly visits to outdoor greenspace lasting 30 min or more could reduce the population prevalence of these illnesses by up to 7% and 9%, respectively [4,36]. 1.3. Reduced Exposure to Air Pollution Air pollution is one of the leading contributors to cardiac, respiratory, and lung cancer-related mortality. Every 10 Œºg/m3 increase in air pollution results in 8%, 6%, and 4% increases in lung cancer, cardiorespiratory, and ‚Äúall-cause‚Äù related mortality, respectively [36]. Higher levels of the air pollutants PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 correlate with the number of visits to physicians, with more severe health risks for people in low socio-economic groups [37]. Konijnendijk and colleagues, in a systematic review of urban park benefits, confirmed that urban parks help remove air pollutants [38]. Through a meta-narrative systematic review, Zupancic and colleagues found that parks with a compact multi-layering of diverse species have the most significant benefits in terms of cooling and air pollution mitigation [39]. A study by Nowak and colleagues estimated the value of the improved air quality attributed to trees in the City of Toronto [1]. The researchers found that trees and shrubs throughout the city removed 1430 metric tons of air pollutants, including CO, NO2, O3, PM10, and SO2, valued at CAD 20.4 million in avoided healthcare costs. The valuation methodology considered several factors, such as the cost of illness, willingness to pay to avoid illness, productivity losses resulting from adverse health events, and the value of a statistical life in cases of mortality. A 2018 study by Nowak et al. on the benefits of tree canopy cover in 86 cities in Canada revealed that tree coverage was able to eliminate 16,500 tons of pollution from the air, and contributed to health benefits amounting to CAD 227.2 million in 2010 [2]. It also prevented 22,000 occurrences of acute respiratory symptoms, and 30 occurrences of human mortality throughout the cities. 2. Materials and Methods This study applied an ecohealth economic valuation framework to estimate the monetary value of health and well-being benefits of investing in a new urban park located in the downtown core of the City of Peterborough, Canada. The proposed park is a 1.2 acre urban square to be developed on land previously used as a parking lot. Figure 1 depicts the location of the proposed park in context with the surrounding area. Map of proposed new urban park (Source: ¬© OpenStreetMap contributors). The proposal emerged out of the 2009 Central Area Master Plan, which called for the creation of a permanent, large, multi-purpose outdoor public square to provide local residents and the business community with access to a variety of park amenities, as well as support city efforts to revitalize the downtown core of the city [40]. Figure 2 presents a conceptual plan of the proposed urban park. Tree planting areas are located on the perimeter of the park and near the water geysers. Passive seating areas will be located in the shade provided by the trees. A public art display in honor of United Nations Peacekeepers will be placed in the northwest area of the park. During the winter season, the hard surface in the southern area of the park can be transformed into an ice-skating surface. The park design also includes a refrigeration building, a change room, and public washrooms. Proposed urban park conceptual plan (Source: LETT ARCHITECTS Inc.). 2.1. Ecohealth Framework The ecohealth framework was developed to support decision makers in understanding the economic returns of health benefits, often overlooked in traditional analyses, resulting from investments in urban parks and greenspace. The framework links greenspace investments and subsequent changes to health outcomes, and the resulting economic benefits attributed to reduced incidences of adverse health outcomes. It was developed under the leadership of the EcoHealth Ontario (EHO) research group and Green Analytics. See Wilson et al., 2020, for a fulsome description of the approach used to develop the ecohealth economic framework [41]. Table 1 expands on the ecohealth framework in the context of the proposed urban park. Investing in a new urban park on land previously used as a parking lot provides new park space in the downtown core with a variety of amenities to serve nearby residents and the local business community. The investment will result in health benefits associated with improvements in physical and mental health attributed to park use, and health benefits resulting from increased vegetation cover. Given the complexity of connecting parks to specific population health outcomes, this study focused on three health outcomes with the strongest corroborating evidence, notably, physical health improvements associated with higher levels of physical activity; improved mental health associated with spending time in parks; and health improvements associated with reduced exposure to air pollution. The respective health improvements contribute to economic savings in terms of avoided costs to the health system. Therefore, estimating the economic benefits of the proposed urban park is a function of two key factors. The first is the incremental increase in park use, which includes the type of use, frequency of use, and time spent in parks, which supports higher levels of physical activity and improved mental health conditions. The second key factor is additional vegetation cover, which reduces exposure to air pollutants. Table 1 Ecohealth framework applied to a new urban park. 2.2. Park Service Area A park service area varies by park size, amenities, size of a city, and population density in the surrounding area. According to the City of Peterborough, the proposed urban park was designed to serve the local community within 800 m of the park, which is equivalent to a ten-minute walk [42]. The service area was determined based on the small park size, demographic profile of the local community, and availability of park space serving adjacent areas. Using the weighted population density of dissemination areas (neighbourhoods) falling within the 800-m radius service area, the park will serve 5919 people [43]. According to Statistics Canada Census data, 21.14% of residents in the service area are aged 65 years and above. Residents aged 25 to 34 years and residents aged 15 to 24 years old account for 18.09% and 16.80% of the service area population, respectively [43]. More than half of the residents in the service area live with low income, with total annual incomes under CAD 30,000 [43]. Detailed demographic and socio-economic data of the park service area are available in the Supplementary Materials. 2.3. Frequency of Park Use The attribution of higher levels of physical activity are a function of park use. The frequency of park use was derived based on the population of the park service area and ease of access. Simply using the distance to the park to determine park accessibility, however, neglects other important factors that influence the willingness to travel, including demographic and socio-economic factors such as age, gender, health status, income, and urban factors such as built environment, public transit, and perceived safety. Drawing on the literature and target distances for access to greenspace commonly adopted by jurisdictions in Canada, ease of access was equated to three distance measures: very easy, equivalent to distances of 400 m or less (an approximate walking time of 5 min); easy, equivalent to distances between 400 m and 1 km (an approximate walking time of 10 min or less); more difficult, equivalent to distances between 1 km and 2 km (an approximate walking time of 20 min or less or a short car ride) [44,45,46]. The literature suggests that on average, 42% of residents with very easy access to a park use it at least once per week [44]. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of residents with easy access to a park use it at least once per week, and 20% of residents with more difficult access use a park once per week [44]. Assuming the weekly park usage rate has a linear relationship with residents‚Äô distance to the park, we estimated that 27% of residents within the service area will use the park weekly. 2.4. Economic Benefits Attributed to Improved Health Outcomes 2.4.1. Increased Physical Activity The health benefit of increased physical activity attributed to park effect is based on the increase in the number of people engaging in moderate to vigorous physical activity on a weekly basis. The estimated economic value was determined by multiplying the change in physically active people by the avoided health care costs associated with physical inactivity. Calculation: Annual health care benefit related to increased physical activity = change in the physically active population within the park service area √ó avoided annual health care costs of physical inactivity per individual. 2.4.2. Improved Mental Health Condition Improvement in mental health condition was calculated by multiplying the population in the park service area with the percentage improvement in mental health conditions attributed to the presence of an urban park. Calculation: Annual health care benefit related to improved mental health condition = population in park service area √ó mental health improvement attributed to presence of an urban park √ó avoided economic burden of mental illness. 2.4.3. Improved Air Quality Vegetation cover reduces exposure to air pollutants, providing population health benefits. The economic value of the health benefits attributed to air quality was obtained by multiplying the tree canopy cover within the park by the annual health savings per hectare of tree canopy cover. Calculation: Air Quality Health Benefit = Park size in hectare √ó percentage of tree canopy cover √ó annual savings per hectare of tree canopy cover for Peterborough. 3. Results 3.1. Increased Physical Activity To determine the incremental increase in the number of physically active people, residents within the 800-m service area were grouped into weekly park users (27%) and non-weekly park users (73%). Among all residents in the service area, the analysis by Kaczynski et al. was used to account for increases in physical activity simply attributed to the presence of a park [9]. Among weekly park users, increases in physical activity were based on the analyses by Kaczynski et al. and Schipperijn et al. that considered the influence of park features and amenities on park-based physical activities [13,47]. The calculation assumed that the baseline number of residents within the park service area that engage in 150 min or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week is 16.4%, which is the Canadian average rate as reported in the 2017 Canadian Health Measures Survey by Statistics Canada [48]. Thus, the development of the downtown urban park will result in an additional 339 adults being physically active, according to the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (at least 150 min of MVPA per week). The economic value was estimated based on the avoided direct health care costs of physical inactivity derived by Krueger and colleagues, which equaled CAD 323.69 per person in 2019 dollars when adjusted for inflation by applying the annual average, not seasonally adjusted, Consumer Price Index as reported by Statistics Canada [49,50]. Therefore, the avoided annual health care costs due to increased levels of physical activity attributed to the development of the downtown urban park is CAD 109,877. 3.2. Improved Mental Health Condition A study by Wood and colleagues found that the presence of a neighbourhood open space, which serves as the recreational and social focus of a community, leads to an increase of 0.15 points measured by the Warwick‚ÄìEdinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) (on a 14‚Äì70 continuous scale) [25]. When converted to a percentage measure, the 0.15-point increase is equivalent to an improvement of 0.2%. It was assumed that for residents within the park service area, park presence will lead to a 0.2% improvement in mental health condition. The economic value associated with improved mental health condition is based on Lim and colleagues‚Äô study of the economic burden of mental illness in Canada which includes health service utilization, long-term and short-term work loss, and health-related quality of life [51]. After adjusting for inflation, the economic burden of mental illness in Canada is CAD 1950 in 2019 dollars per person per year. A 0.20% improvement in mental health condition among residents in the catchment area (5919) is equivalent to an avoided economic burden of CAD 23,084 per year. 3.3. Improved Air Quality The annual health savings per hectare of tree canopy cover was derived for the City of Peterborough based on a previous analysis by Nowak and colleagues [2]. After adjusting for inflation, the health savings per hectare was CAD 653 in 2019 dollars. According to the City of Peterborough Parks Development Standards, the park aims to provide at least 40% tree canopy cover [42]. The economic value was obtained by multiplying the park‚Äôs size in hectares with the percentage of tree canopy cover and annual health savings per hectare of tree canopy cover. The urban park‚Äôs contribution to better air quality will create an annual health savings of CAD 126.84. 3.4. Summary of Economic Benefits As noted in Table 2, the development of the small urban park will result in annual economic benefits of CAD 133,000 per year. The benefits include CAD 109,877 in the avoided economic burden of physical inactivity, CAD 23,084 in health savings associated with improved mental health, and CAD 127 in health savings attributed to better air quality. Table 2 Summary of economic benefits of proposed urban park (CAD, 2019). 4. Discussion Competing land use pressures and municipal responsibility for costs associated with park operation and maintenance can make it challenging for decision makers to support the development and expansion of urban parks. Applying the ecohealth framework highlights the economic value of health benefits linked to greenspace use and exposure. The results reported in this case study represent a portion of the proposed park‚Äôs value, as we only considered a subset of known benefits attributed to park use and vegetation cover. Other benefits of the park could include, but are not limited to, respite from hot temperatures, heat island reduction in the city centre, relief from noise pollution, increased biodiversity, business attraction due to enhanced downtown environments and social benefits resulting from stronger feelings of community cohesion, higher levels of community engagement, and reduced isolation. A notable benefit we excluded was respite from heat-related stress provided by increased vegetation cover. We deemed this benefit to be marginal, as the proposed park is a small urban square. The current plan indicates that 20 trees will be planted. While the shading provided by the trees will be beneficial, the impact of the trees in reducing the surface level temperature is likely minimal. Notable limitations of this analysis are the reliance on assumptions drawn from the broader literature and the application of regional or national average data to the specific case area. For instance, our estimate of park usage was based solely on park proximity, and did not consider population characteristics or pre-existing health conditions of residents within the service area. Additionally, the calculation of annual health savings attributed to an increase in tree canopy cover was based on data from a tree canopy study conducted in Peterborough by Nowak et al. [2]. The actual reduction in air pollutants and corresponding health savings would be contingent on factors such as the size and species of trees planted in the park, traffic volume on surrounding streets, and proximity to industrial areas [52]. Incorporating community-specific data into future studies that utilize the ecohealth framework would increase the rigor of the results. An assumption used in our analysis which is open to debate is the delineation of the park service area to be an 800-m radius of the park. This range was adopted from the Peterborough park development plan. However, the proposed park uses, such as a weekly farmers‚Äô market and features such as a skating surface in the winter, would likely draw users from outside the targeted service area. To illustrate this point, a 2009 national farmers‚Äô market impact study of 70 farmers markets in Canada found that 69% of visitors use vehicles to reach these markets, suggesting a high probability of visitors living outside the local service area [53]. Hence, future analysis should consider a wider park service area. In addition to considering the potential benefits, such an analysis would need to consider the associated costs of pollution generated by vehicle use to reach the park. We adopted park user estimates using access thresholds common in Canadian municipal policy guidelines, which were largely influenced by the WHO 2016 guidelines, European access to greenspace indicators, and Natural England [4,44,45,46,54]. Therefore, we assumed in this study that easy access or close proximity to park was within 400 m or less. A review article by Ekkel and de Vries (2016) affirmed a consensus in the literature that proximity to greenspace supports human health which is typically between 300 and 500 m. They noted, however, that there appears to be no empirical support for a specific cut-off value at those distances [55]. A study by Shindler and colleagues (2022), examining park use in three European cities, challenged the common policy assumption of park use largely being a function of proximity based on hundreds of meters. Their results suggested a median range of 1.4 to 1.9 km, which is much higher than the 400- and 800-m thresholds used in this study. Their study also noted, however, that respondents with access to quality local urban greenspace tended to travel less to reach an urban greenspace [56]. In the context of this study, as shown in Figure 1, users outside the 800-m park service have access to nearby high-quality greenspaces, suggesting that they would be less inclined to travel to the proposed park. Schindler and colleagues‚Äô findings highlight a need for applications of the ecohealth framework to be based on actual park user data. The potential to use mobile phone data to track park use and time in parks offers an interesting means to validate assumptions on the willingness to travel, mode of travel, and time spent in parks. Assumptions regarding calculations of park users, park service area, health outcomes and economic benefits, drew on robust and well-regarded studies, or integrated consistent trends aggregated from across studies. These assumptions are open to debate. Calculations could easily be refined and updated as more locally relevant data become available, or to reflect changes in assumptions or new knowledge. In addition to health system savings, we explored estimating the well-being benefit of the park based on contributions of the park to higher levels of life satisfaction. We estimated the well-being benefit by multiplying the population within the service area by improvement in life satisfaction scores per person attributed to the presence of an urban park. Pfeiffer and colleagues found that an additional acre of park space within a resident‚Äôs living environment increased their life satisfaction score by 0.007 points (on a 1‚Äì5 scale), using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) [24]. Based on the acreage of the proposed urban park, it is estimated that, for the 5919 residents within the park service area, each of them will experience a 0.0084-point increase in life satisfaction as measured by the SWLS. We derived the economic value of the associated improvement in life satisfaction based on the replacement cost of experiencing a similar improvement in life satisfaction. We adapted results from a study by Lora and Chaparro, where they found that increasing average life satisfaction by one point on the SWLS scale in a developed country requires a per capita annual income of CAD 82,589 (in 2019 dollars), on average [57]. The 0.0084-point increase in life satisfaction anticipated by the park development equals an income increase of CAD 694 per resident in the catchment area, or CAD 4.1 million. While we can attach an economic value to higher levels of life satisfaction, we opted to report this value separately, given potential overlaps with improved physical health and mental health condition. In addition, policy makers and practitioners are less familiar with and confident in reporting the economic value of higher life satisfaction attributed to a park. When including the economic value of improved life satisfaction of CAD 4.1 million, the total health return on investment in one year is equivalent to 65% of the initial development cost. The payback or health return on park investment, in this case, is 1.5 years. Future research on the ecohealth benefits provided by urban parks and greenspaces should be expanded to include a broader set of benefits. A notable benefit to include is respite from hot temperatures and extreme heat, given the increased frequency and duration of heatwaves around the world, and the strong links between heat stress and heat-related illness and mortality [58,59,60,61]. More generally, the economic analysis of health benefits would improve with greater understanding of the relationship between greenspace and health outcomes. To enhance the precision of park access thresholds, additional investigations could be conducted to incorporate neighborhood-specific factors, including socio-demographic and cultural variables, local urban design features such as bike lanes, pedestrian-friendly streetscapes, and public transit accessibility, and the availability of greenspace in the surrounding area. Current assumptions regarding park access thresholds in Canadian urban areas primarily rely on standards set by the World Health Organization or thresholds adopted by major cities such as Vancouver and Toronto [4,45,46]. However, mid-sized Canadian cities such as Peterborough have distinct urban environments that require further examination. A potentially innovative approach to assessing park accessibility involves utilizing mobile phone location data to track actual park utilization, distances traveled, and time spent in parks. In addition, future research could delve into how city officials and community groups employ economic data on the health benefits associated with parks and greenspaces in practical applications, thereby gaining a better understanding of how such studies can bolster efforts to invest in green initiatives aimed at improving public health and strengthening urban climate resilience. 5. Conclusions This case study included the economic value of health benefits associated with higher levels of physical activity, improved mental health condition, and reduced exposure to air pollutants that would result from investing in a new urban park in downtown Peterborough. The results demonstrate the economic value of health benefits attributed to the development of the proposed urban park. Quantifying the health benefits provides planners, policy makers, and municipalities with a more fulsome understanding of the value provided by urban parks. Investing in urban green space creates health, social, and environmental benefits for a community. Various health benefits, such as higher levels of physical activity, improvement in mental health condition, and reduced exposure to air pollutants, have economic value that is often ignored or overlooked in budgetary and planning exercises and decision making. This study provides evidence of those benefits by applying an ecohealth economic framework to quantify the monetary value of health benefits associated with the development of an urban park in downtown Peterborough, Canada. The study highlights the importance of urban parks and greenspaces to population health, and more generally as a community asset.

    "content": "DIY Litter Box Cabinet Turn any small cabinet into a stylish way to hide your litter box, with a convenient removable top and cat door. Sharing your home with pets ‚Äì splendid, boisterous, and amusing as it may be ‚Äì does create a few challenges for those of us who live in small spaces, such as myself. Needless to say, I am constantly looking for new and creative solutions for living beautifully with my menagerie of animals. Although cats make fantastic pets for small apartments and condos, one of the challenges that I have faced over and over again as a proud cat owner is where to sneakily hide my little darling‚Äôs hideous open litter box from sight. After cringing at the price tags of a few of the innovative and modern designed litter boxes online, I decided that it made more sense to construct an inexpensive and simple piece myself. I started keeping my eyes open for the perfect piece to repurpose in a clever way to disguise my kitty Yoshimi‚Äôs private business. Reclaimed Cabinet Screwdriver Sandpaper Power Drill Jigsaw High-Gloss Black Polyurethane-Based Spray Paint Dowel/Scrap Wood Finishing Nails Wood Glue Luckily for me, living in a big college town does have its advantages. During the summers, large portions of the student body jet out to internships, relocate to new apartments, or move back home to work and visit their families. During the big move-out week, these young academics line the campus alleys with discarded goods. I happened to visit a friend during these times of the great student body exodus and stumbled upon a roadside goldmine of abandoned furniture (aka future projects). A jettisoned side cabinet, outdated though it was and differing from my own usual aesthetic standards, was in absolutely perfect condition and featured an open-weave cane top. It was the perfect starting point for my DIY pet project. I immediately threw the beast into the back of the truck, my wheels a-turnin‚Äô. With a bit of smart reconstruction, I succeeded in creating a removable top for easy scooping and a simple kitty door. This hefty forgotten relic of ‚Äò80s suburbia became the perfect place to disguise my cat‚Äôs kitty litter box and provide her with some well deserved privacy. DIY Litter Box Cabinet Step 1. Disassemble! I started by breaking down as much of the cabinet as I could to prepare it for painting. Using a simple Phillips head screwdriver, I carefully removed the door, hinges, cabinet hardware, and top panel of the table. Tip: Be sure to set all of your screws and hardware aside for later ‚Äì even if you don‚Äôt use them to finish this project, they may come in handy sometime down the line. Step 2. Cut Out a Cat Door Using a power drill and a large bit, I drilled pilot holes into the corners of my cabinet door and then used a jigsaw to carefully cut out the center panel. After a bit of light sanding to smooth out the freshly cut edges, I took everything and wiped it down thoroughly. Step 3. Paint I selected a black high-gloss spray paint that was polyurethane-based and low-VOC to create a beautiful finish and allow for easy clean-up. Allowing for the proper drying times as recommended by the manufacturer, I applied two thin, full coats of paint. Step 4. Create an Easily Removable Top and Reassemble After allowing a few days for everything to dry completely, I traced around where the frame came in contact with the lid of the table. Then using a thin layer of wood glue and finishing nails, I attached small scraps of dowel just inside those marks on the four sides of the lid. These dowels will settle the lid securely on top of the cabinet and allow for easy human access to the hidden litter box inside. To finish everything, I simply replaced the cabinet door with its new kitty portal and voila! Yoshimi‚Äôs secret ninja lair was complete! This DIY project gave an outdated piece of furniture a new lease on life and solved the common problem of the ugly litter box in a small apartment.

Brooks and Oprah Winfrey share in a conversation with Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, about the pair‚Äôs new book, Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier. Harvard University President Claudine Gay and Professor and Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Development and Research Tsedal Neeley also make remarks.\n \nHow can we mobilize our lives toward greater happiness? How do we translate ideas about happiness into action? How do we take control of our present and future? Winfrey and Brooks have each spent decades tackling big topics like how to find happiness and achieve self-actualization. In their fascinating collaborative book, they lay out their hard-earned wisdom in concrete steps with practical solutions for how to strengthen four crucial pillars of happiness: family, friendship, work, and faith. In this intimate, powerful conversation, you‚Äôll hear them discuss what they‚Äôve learned about happiness ‚Äî why it matters, how to build your blueprint for a more fulfilling future, the adventure that awaits you in the process, personal stories that didn‚Äôt make it into the book, and more.\n\n#OprahWinfrey #ArthurBrooks #Happiness",

I wasn‚Äôt a great student in high school and started out at a community college. I love that the Extension School provides access to higher education for folks who may not have been given clear pathways into that world or may not initially see themselves in it. VIDEO: Dr. Wilson shares why he enjoys teaching at Harvard Extension. The range of life experiences and perspectives in our classes‚Äîstudents from around the world and at different ages and stages of life‚Äîactivates a quality of conversation that you really can‚Äôt get anywhere else. Why Shakespeare? Shakespeare provides an amazing opportunity to bridge past and present when thinking about big ethical questions‚Äîhis plays are deeply informed by ancient art, culture, and thought but they‚Äôre also very alive today around the world in new performances and adaptations. Check out Dr. Wilson‚Äôs guest appearance on the Folger Library‚Äôs Shakespeare Lightning Round on Instagram. I like tracing these centuries-long intellectual debates and conversations to see how different people with different circumstances, values, and commitments can interpret the same story in very different ways. Academic Writing Advice for Students Writing is easy when you‚Äôve got something to say. The hard part is building an idea that‚Äôs worth writing a paper about. That‚Äôs where you should spend your time and energy. Embrace your perspective‚Äîthe worldview you bring to your writing that‚Äôs informed by your experiences and values. You have hard-won expertise and authority to speak from that perspective, which allows you to shift from someone trying to convince a reader to believe something to someone with knowledge that their reader may not have and desperately needs. Connecting with Students In our Fundamentals of Grammar course, we do a series of assignments called ‚ÄúWriting You Can Use.‚Äù The stories that grow from that assignment are amazing‚Äîfrom emails to long-lost friends that rekindled relationships to successful job applications to published opinion articles in local newspapers to the letter a student sent (from her new typewriter) to Tom Hanks (who is apparently a typewriter enthusiast) that he responded to (from his typewriter).

    "description": "Jeff Wilson teaches on the first year writing program at Harvard University and since March he has shifted all of his classes online. He describes the emotions the students felt when the decision was made to cancel live classes and move online. The importance of the University as a place of safety for his students was part of the reason that Jeff put a huge amount of effort into creating online classes that would support new kinds of learning for his students. From the beginning of the crisis he contacted his class individually to discuss their specific circumstances. \n\nDespite the enormous upheaval that shifting to online learning caused Jeff found that the students responded well to the new ways of working. In fact in one case he found that the essays produced at the end of the spring term of 2020 were some of the most thoughtful and engaged essays he had ever read. A small group of these students submitted their work for publication to highlight the work they had done on the Public Theatre production of 'Much Ado About Nothing' and its importance to the Black Lives Matters movement. https://lithub.com/black-lives-matter-in-the-public-theaters-much-ado-about-nothing/ \n\nThinking through the benefits of this disruptive period Jeff points out how the intensity of the connections made with his students and between the students is something he will take away from this experience. He also points out how the pandemic lockdown forced him to think through his approach to teaching and to talk to colleagues and students about how working online can alter the hierarchies of the University setting.",

As an academic who started out as an actor, Quarmby has many years of experience working with groups of students both in person and virtually. His work with Shakespeare's Globe, as an Education Practitioner, helped him to understand working in that space and prepared him to review the Russian production of 'Measure for Measure' that featured in the Globe to Globe Festival. He develop his skills online while teaching a transatlantic course with Emory University in Georgia. As a former student of the Open University Quarmby was prepared for the conditions of teaching in lockdown more than most, yet he points out some of the limitations of the environment in  this useful discussion.   \n\nThis conversation will offer any teacher struggling to get to grips with the online environment plenty of suggestions as well as reassurances about how best to communication with students at a distance.",
